I joined the high school band in freshman year and by senior year I became one of the best in my section. My academics were always straight and I exercised daily. Senior year I enlisted in the military and now I believe it was one of my worst decisions in life. Before I went to boot camp I was motivated, a patriot and believed that the elite joined the military. In senior year I never applied for any scholarships and I was offered one but turned it down because I already signed the papers. I thought I set myself up for success. Now I believe I was dead wrong for joining. The only benefit I see so far after a year and a half of service is that I'm trying to set myself up financially before I get out and hopefully attend college. It sounds like a plan but I feel no happiness from what I do at all. I convinced myself there's no honor in it anymore, it's just another job. I don't exercise by myself anymore. I feel like I'm not progressing anywhere in life being in service. I'm just a body and if I wasn't here doing what I'm doing, there'd just be somebody else doing the exact same. I'm replaceable. That's the mindset the military gave me. I look forward to going back home in 6 months for vacation and that's the only thing I've been looking forward to since I've been stationed. After that, the only thing I have my eyes on are getting out of service, going home, being closer to my family again. There's nothing here that satisfies me and I hate it.

      "Sample 3: {'post_title': 'Stuck between moving forward and killing myself', 'post_text': 'Some background information: My GF of almost 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago and ever since I have been severely depressed. It wasn\\'t a bad break-up, just a sad one. Shortly after the break-up, I noticed I wasn\\'t dealing with it well at all. I couldn\\'t do anything but cry and wishing she would come back. I went to a psychologist and he diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). I still had friendly contact with my ex, but I was just hoping she would come back. After an emotional call, she told me to take a few months for myself. And so I did, but I just got worse. I couldn\\'t do anything. I stopped working, studying, playing sports, everything, because I had no energy or motivation for it. I almost got admitted to a psych ward, but it was still my choice to do stay there or not. I chose to not do it as I had a bad feeling about it. October of last year, I contacted her again and we met for the first time in months. It was supposed to just be friendly, but talking about the relationship was inevitable. She said to me she would never take me back. She wasn\\'t angry, but just serious and honest. It broke me even more. The next day I sent her a goodbye text and was close to killing myself. She called just in time and we had a good talk. Though a few weeks later, when things look better and we actually had made plans to meet up as friends, I got a panic attack and sent her emotional texts. She sent me a long one back and then blocked me. I then attempted suicide again, this time getting hospitalized. I have not directly spoken to her since. It was either via other people or letters. Last December I sent her a suicide letter, but I quickly regretted it. My brother sent her a message for me, apologizing to her and telling her I\\'m okay. Then for Christmas, I sent her a simple card, but never got a response nor did I expect one to be honest.\\n\\nAt this point I have accepted she won\\'t talk to me, that she will not come back to me and probably will never do so. However, I cannot accept never getting a chance with her again. In March/April she is leaving the country and I fear I will never see or talk to her again in person. All I need is to talk with her and some understanding. Though I know I have messed things up so bad. I have put so much stress on her. I have done everything wrong while I knew better, but still I did it.\\n\\nSo far I have been diagnosed with MDD and Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)(so a double depression), and they said I show signs of anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a personality disorder (e.g. avoidant, dependent, anti-social, existential OCD). I am still at the early stages so I won\\'t have a definitive diagnosis for a quite some time still. What is certain is that there is something really wrong with me. Most of it originates from my horrible childhood and upbringing. Only the MDD was actually caused by the break-up. Still, my ex thinks she and the break-up are the main causes of my current state, but that is simply not true. Of course, I cannot tell her as she won\\'t speak to me nor believe me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Now here is my dilemma: I feel the pressure to move forward with my life. I feel like I have to take on all these life responsibilities again; that I have to live my life to the fullest. I always felt like that, but because I keep overthinking everything I become this passive person who does only the minimum. I feel incredibly weak, pathetic, and scared to do almost anything, like a little kid in grown man\\'s body. Even though I know I can do some things well, I just do not have any solid confidence. If I do nothing then my life won\\'t get better and I will for sure never get back with my ex. Though I don\\'t see the point of putting in all this effort to do things if it doesn\\'t make me happy. I don\\'t even have the energy or motivation for it. Every time I hear someone say: \"Move on!\", \"Man up!\", \"Do \\\\[this\\\\] or do \\\\[that\\\\], I already feel the pressure and it cripples me. It\\'s not even that I don\\'t want to do it. I really want to live a good and healthy life, but it\\'s like I am incapable of doing so. Seeing other people getting further in life also paralyzes me as well as watching vids on how to improve myself. Everything just scares me and paralyzes me. Still, I know it\\'s the only way out of this and my only chance of ever getting her back. However, there is no guarantee I\\'ll get her back. So that thought is depressing on its own. And don\\'t get me wrong. I know there are other girls out there. That is not the problem. I am not ugly and I can date girls, and I have done so for months already. I have had bad dates and great dates, and I have met great girls I could picture a relationship with, but it simply doesn\\'t do it for me. I want my ex. Even when I put all the emotions aside and try to rationalize it, then I still want her. Right now I just feel trapped. Moving forward won\\'t make me happy. It is not enough. Though sitting still and doing nothing won\\'t make me happy either. At this point, suicide seems like the only solution, but even that is a scary and hard thing to do. However, I feel it\\'s the right thing to do as I feel far too broken and useless to continue this unsatisfying life. I wish there was some magical solution. I wish my ex would give the benefit of the doubt. I wish she would give me another chance. I wish she would make that sacrifice to help me. Though I know that that is ridiculous. I know that I have to do it all by myself; that it is my responsibility... but I cannot do it anymore. I am hopeless, desperate, and dysfunctional... What can I still possibly do?!**\\n\\nCall me anything you want, swear at me, tell me I am a pussy, call me cringy, give me those hard truths again. Do it if you want.\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTl;dr: GF of 3 years broke up with me over half a year ago. I want her back, but I made every mistake there is. I plunged into depression and I got diagnosed with several mental illnesses. I feel the pressure to move forward, but it\\'s crippling me. I am too weak and scared to go on, especially when I won\\'t get my ex back. I feel absolutely worthless and pathetic. Right now the only solution seems to be suicide because even if I go on I won\\'t be satisfied and happy...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;', 'annotations': [['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]}\n",

So thank you to whomever shares any words of wisdom you’re all I got. \\n\\nOver the the last year our relationship has dwindled, we still tell each other we love each other constantly and talk about getting engaged/married. But we don’t have conversations like we used to, she always falls asleep on the couch so we don’t sleep together hardly, we don’t have sex at all, I think 6 times total last year, that has been a big point of frustration at least for me - I’ve tried to initiate sex and been shot down so many times that I’ve all but given up at this point, even when it’s your lover, your best friend, it still feels like crap when you get rejected. I’ve tried to talk to her about it many times the day after or some time that is away from sex so we can have a calm conversation about it but everyone so far, every time we have talked she’s gotten worked up and basically says she doesn’t feel like it. We both have HPV so sometimes that gets in the way but whenever we’ve talked it’s always that she’s not in the mood. I feel like she’s not telling me something. \\n\\nI feel as if we’ve stopped growing and are maybe even starting to resent each other, which is scary to me. I get paranoid that she’s cheating on me sometimes, which I highly doubt she is, I think it’s just me trying to rationalize the lack of sex. Most of all I feel like this entire relationship is about her, and it’s frustrating me lately. I honestly don’t mean to sound like a jerk here; I’m certainly not entitled to anything and while I know her story better than anyone I have no idea what it was really like to experience those traumas growing up and how it effects her today. \\n\\nI don’t even know how to explain how I’m feeling. I’m constantly having the internal debate: “Well what about me?”- “Fuck about you! What about her!?” And so on. While writing this post I kind of caught myself switching between my 2 head-spaces.\\n\\nHeadspace A: \\n“That being said.. why can’t it be about me sometimes? Shouldn’t a relationship be 50/50? I’ve really never been an attention seeker so I’m fine with 30/70 or 20/80? Anything at this point. It’s not though, everything we do is dictated by her depression.”\\n\\nHeadspace B:\\n“A few weeks ago while I was alone doing laundry I just started hysterically crying I couldn’t breathe, it really freaked me out. Nothing like that has ever happened to me before. Earlier that day she had called me crying and saying “she just wants it to be over. She just wants to give up. She wants to die” I love her so much and i’m scared for her and for us.”\\n\\nAm I just a shitty person for wanting it to be about me sometimes? I feel like a prick even saying that. Of course I’ve never told her about this, she has enough to worry about and I want to be her rock, not another burden, a toddler, whining about not getting enough attention. So I don’t say anything, instead I just get distant, which I recognize and I hate that I do that. I’m just angry at this situation and don’t know how else to react. \\n\\nI want our relationship to be what it once was; fun and exciting. How can I help this relationship? How do I bring up my inner man-child who needs her attention or do I bring it up at all? \\n\\nThanks so much for any help.', 'annotations': [['Feeling-bad-about-yourself-or-that-you-are-a-failure-or-have-let-yourself-or-your-family-down', 'yes'], ['Feeling-down-depressed-or-hopeless', 'yes'], ['Feeling-tired-or-having-little-energy', 'yes'], ['Little-interest-or-pleasure-in-doing ', 'yes'], ['Moving-or-speaking-so-slowly-that-other-people-could-have-noticed-Or-the-opposite-being-so-fidgety-or-restless-that-you-have-been-moving-around-a-lot-more-than-usual', 'no'], ['Poor-appetite-or-overeating', 'no'], ['Thoughts-that-you-would-be-better-off-dead-or-of-hurting-yourself-in-some-way', 'yes'], ['Trouble-concentrating-on-things-such-as-reading-the-newspaper-or-watching-television', 'no'], ['Trouble-falling-or-staying-asleep-or-sleeping-too-much', 'no']]}\n"

      "I got depressed and severely melancholic ( experience debiliating guilt ans self-hatred )  and could not function well for months/ years after certain events happened so I relate to my brother and understand him very well. However, the difference between my brother and I is that I sought help and still speak to someone every 2 weeks.. \n",
      "\n",
      "My brother was always forced into help by CPS for example.  He also is a high-school drop-out (2x) because of the home environment and I know that the social stigma that comes with this has really weighed down on his self-esteem. He is very smart ( beat a Canadian chess champion at chess ) but he never takes compliments and feels like his depression has altered his ability to retain information ( poor memory, brain fog ) . He is VERY hard on himself and I almost feel like he would rather stay depressed as a way to self-punish himself for dropping out of highschool ( he even told me he feels like he does not deserve anything good because he is in his own words a  \"  loser \".. and feels like he is tired of being alive. Not exactly suicidal in that he does not intent to kill himself but he is fed up of living so could very well do something dangerous if this continues ). \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been pestering my brother to move out of my parents for the longest time. He finally did last week  and came to live with me. I congratulated him for taking the right steps.I told him he always has a place with me. And this is why I still took him in despite having reservations as I am not exactly where I want to be in my life financially  either but I am doing better than him and better than before so I felt like it's worth a shot ( and still do ) . He has never worked a single job because of his mental illness and because of my parents hostility.\n",
      "\n",
      "This past year I have focused a lot on healing from my own health issues: had two surgeries and heart issues but I feel better than ever before and also getting over a breakup which is hard for someone like.me who tends to get reactive depression as a result of difficult life events . \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm doing well at work, was recruited by my manager to follow into her foot septs and applied to a program  at McGill university that my employer would pay for the purpose of developping my career at the hospital I work for. I work in admin and might work in management following this management succession program ( if they accept me because even though I was recruited still waiting for acceptance letter ).\n",
      "\n",
      "But it took me a long while  to get to a place where I can be stable enough (mentally) to get back on track or at least try too. I have anxiety too ( was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ) but I feel like it's been under control the last few monrhs. Moreover , I have my own fears of failure as I've had a difficult experience with school in the past even though I graduated highschool and college .. \n",
      "\n",
      "My brother is the sweetest person. He is 20, however  never grew up or matured properly due to lack of socialization... Never experience love, only had friends before his teens and made virtual friends via his gaming on Xbox until this day... While my mom drank and my dad was aggressive all these years,  my brother would go hide in his room gaming all night and sleping all day and hasn't left his room until child protective services took him out for 1.5 years.  And they only did because I told them what was going on... Anyways. Fast forward and  now he is finally with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to be the best support but I haven't stopped feeling anxiety since he moved in. Like I am not eating as well and I am worried this will make me feel isolated or ruin my other relationships ( don't have many left haha but 2-3)  but also worried for him too as he won't eat unless I tell him to, won't move his body unless I  tell him to etc... Having him here reminds me of the misery of my parents and my childhood. Because he is unfortunately the result of a dysfunctional family.  I don't want to turn into my mom where I cook and clean all the time ( she is a functioning alcoholic but gets highly abusive when she drinks but still cooked and cleaned ) even though I cooked for.myself growing up as I'm vegan and she didn't want to cook vegan food for me when I turned 19. \n",
      "\n",
      "I want my brother to feel confident but he doesn't because he dropped out of highschool twice as a result of mental illness growing up. Before coming to stay with me he was starring to refuse food and had severe psychomotor retardation ( can't get our of bed ) and like I maybe mentioned before he has not gotten out of bed in a decade expect for when CPS got involved .\n",
      "\n",
      "I booked him an appointment with a family doctor on Friday ( tomorrow )  and I spoke to my own therapist who recommended me a program  to recommend to the doctor for my brother.They do a more intensive follow-up for mental health adults that lasts 2 years and they work at the patient 's pace... My fear is he will give up or not accept the help even though he told me he is open to it last Sunday. Yesterday he started getting hesitant again saying he didn't want to do the work but also he is aware he needs to get better..\n",
      "\n",
      "What my concerns are ; \n",
      "1.Basically I know that I have what it takes to help him and objectively he is better off with me that he is with my parents and since he has nowhere else to go I won't let him starve or end up on the steet. But, I want to know how to get past my  own emotions and fears and anxieties regarding this entire situation and NOT identify with his depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. I want to set healthy boundaries also where I don't get caught up in saving him because I already feel like I'm trying to do that... but I don't know what that would look like... should I give him a contract or make him sign a \"promise to himself \" what do I do if after a year he has not progressed ? Should there be \"consequences \" not punishments but, a different recommendation ? I don't want to end up taking care of.him forever I want him to heal with me and get back on his feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.Moreover,  I don't want his depression to trigger me and I don't want his negativity ( not shaming him he is just very depressed and sick and needs help but his depression makes him so negative about everything ) to bring me down, I want to keep pushing for a better life for myself and my brother without the negativty bringing me down as I worked so hard to get to a somewhat surface level healthy mindset ( I say this because I.myself can get easily triggered and spiral if things feel to overwhelming especially when it comes to my family ) ... It worries me because everything he says is a cognitive distortion and in life, as we know, you become the people you hang out with the most..\n",
      "4 . I want him.to become more resilient, I am not expecting a cure but I want him to be processing in the right direction not the other way around.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  I also respect that he has a serious disease that needs medical attention and specialized / tailored follow-ups.  I want to be a good example to him...  one that is different from my parents.. He has become like them . Negative about everything on top of having severe psychomotor retardation and lack of appetite ( hence why I am am getting him to the doctor tomorrow ). \n",
      "\n",
      "6. He has been on antidepressants before but it wasn't good. He had more appetite but still didn't leave his room. Meds are not unknown to him. I believe tomorrow the doctors help will give us the best choices for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. He is aware he is sick and even agrees he needs meds, we.watched a 50 min video by Dr. Sapolsky yesterday regarding how depression affects the brain and he realized just how affective depression is to the hypocampus etc... My brother knows he has congirive distortions most of the time. How do I keep him motivated to stay on track and improve slowly slowly day by day ? \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess in conclusion my biggest fear is that taking care of him gets me sick too ( I think it's a valid fear considering I am mentally fragile ans afraid of ending up depressed too )\n",
      "\n",
      "DISCLAIMER: I don't want comments telling me he should be helped by someone else. He had nobody else and it is my pleasure to help him and be there for him forever. I just have legitimate concerns that I believe your tips and advice could help me navigate the situation better.\n",

I booked him an appointment with doctor for tomorrow but I need ripe on how to take on this responsibility without letting his negativity ( not shaming him as this is a symptom of his depression ) get to me and make me depressed too.

I hit my 20's, now 23 yrs old, and I am having constant depression cycles. The cycles are becoming more frequent and each time it feels harder to come out of. As of lately I have been probably the most down that I have felt to date. I am in my sophomore year of college as a bio major. I haven't been keeping up with classes, I have been failing exams and I don't have nearly enough credits to keep my scholarship for my junior year. I have fucked myself so badly with school I don't know what to do. I want so badly to take a leave of absence to get myself together, up my medication and see a therapist. I really want to get better. However, if I take a leave from school I will lose all financial aid for my junior year as well. My fiancé and I are pretty financially responsible people and have budgeted out for the next year and a half based on the financial aid we both receive. It is not an option to lose that money or we will be completely fucked. I am asking advice on what to do. I need to take a break from school or I will just keep digging myself deeper into this GPA and depression nightmare, but we also can't lose any money from it. I do want to reenroll for the fall semester, but I just need a break now. I am lost. Any advice would be so helpful.\n",

      "Annotations: My Mum has struggled with severe depression ever since her early teens. She has been on a variety of antidepressants on and off for many years and has attempted suicide (to the best of my knowledge) twice before. She has never kept up with therapy (of any sort) as she doesn’t believe it works.\n",
      "Previously when she fell into a depressive state she would become incredibly pessimistic and irritable, withdrawn, sleep long hours - really just your average symptoms of depression.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent times (over the last 6 months) her behaviour has escalated to the point where I am deeply concerned that she will attempt suicide again:    \n",
      "•She doesn’t socialise. She has always had a small social group but is now not even engaging in the two things she had been keeping up with for years (daily gym and a monthly book club) and refuses to do anything ‘new’ (due to the cost).   \n",
      "•She hates her job and her co-workers, but will not look for other employment because she considers herself ‘too old’ to get employment elsewhere. Her hatred of her workplace has escalated to the point where she will literally just leave, without advising anyone, and go home to bed. She justifies this as ‘they wouldn’t notice me if i was there anyway’. Previously she has always had an incredibly strong work ethic, she wouldn’t miss a day ever!    \n",
      "•She is unwilling to stay on antidepressants for extended periods. She doesn’t like that they make her gain weight (~5kgs) OR shes feels that they have ‘done their job’ and stops taking them cold turkey. This particular behaviour has been an ongoing problem for as long as I can remember but now she won’t even consider making an appointment to get a script.    \n",
      "•She is sending nasty texts and emails to her siblings and cousins, accusing them of imagined petty insults towards her and reacting disproportionately when they tell her that she is acting inappropriately and needs to seek help, she believes they are just trying to get rid of her. Previously they had a friendly but distant relationship without regular contact.    \n",
      "•Calling me and my sister at all hours of the day and night in tears (mostly when she is drunk) to ‘just talk’ and keeping us on the phone for literally hours (her last call to me was 4hrs and 42 minutes at 10pm) until she feels ‘better’ or passes out. This occurs approximately twice a week to both of us. Previously we would text regularly and call about every 7-10 days.     \n",
      "•Refusing to deal with anything concerning her Mothers (my grandma, 88f) increasingly poor health. She started doing this as she suspects that ‘people’ think she is trying to kill Grandma (which is completely unfounded). She had previously been the main point of contact for the local council and doctors for anything related to Grandma’s care and has had medical power of attorney for abut a decade - a sibling has since taken over responsibility for facilitating Grandmas care as a direct result of her behaviour.    \n",
      "•She has begun drinking increasingly heavily over the  the last ~2years. Currently she consuming 1-2 bottles of wine most nights, has very recently starting consuming spirts in addition to this. She is routinely drinking to the point where she is passing out in her own vomit. Previously she was only a light social drinker.    \n",
      "•Frequently making statements such as  ‘just wanting to die’, ‘I should just die’, ‘someone should just shoot me’, ‘i’ll just die’. This is happening multiple times in the same conversation, it must be adding up to hundreds of instances per day.\n",
      "There have been many other behaviour changes I have noticed but the ones listed are the ones that are new to her and are alarming me the most.\n",
      "\n",
      "For further context, she lives alone in a country town, does not have a significant other or any pets and my sister and I both live hours away from her (and have done so for years) as do all her siblings. She has had some major stressors  in her life recently.    \n",
      "•Obviously Coronavirus has been a big thing, she is an essential worker and has been working the whole time.    \n",
      "•Her employer has recently sold their business and she is very concerned about her job stability when the new owners take over. -Grandma’s health has been worsening and Grandma is resisting the idea of going into a care home. Although Mum isn’t dealing with Grandma’s care anymore she is still stressed about it.    \n",
      "•She believes she is getting bullied at work (claims to be getting ‘cold-shouldered’ and that people are hiding her belongings). She has worked there for about 10 years without incident before now and I have not seen any other evidence for this aside from her word (which I do not consider trustworthy in her current state).\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried to help her by:    \n",
      "•Convincing her to begin antidepressants again (which she is refusing to do, she will ‘get fat again’).    \n",
      "•To at least see a therapist (she is refusing to as it ‘doesn’t work’, also the only counselor in town is one of her cousins who she has been ‘fighting’ with -see above, I asked if she would consider travelling to see someone in another town or even zoom sessions with someone but she still steadfastly refused). I did ensure that she has helpline numbers easily accessible (saved in her mobile, on the fridge and beside all the landlines in the house).    \n",
      "•Encouraging her to reach out to her friends and have a coffee or meal together (she refuses to ask because she believes they will reject her invite, a ‘why bother’ mentality. She also refuses to go out when they do invite her to things because she ‘doesn’t feel like it’).   \n",
      "•Actively making plans with her (which she has always bailed on despite apparent excitement beforehand). I have been in contact with several of her close friends and explained my concerns (which they have shared) and asked if they can make special effort to explicitly include her when getting together (which I know they have as we have been in ongoing contact) but she still has not been engaging.    \n",
      "•Taking all her calls and trying to (gently) help her see that some of her present mindsets are distorted when she calls (I want her to recognise that she needs help so hopefully she will be open to trying something).    \n",
      "•Offering to pay dues for any clubs or organisations she would like to try (as she claims she can not afford them). Offering suggestions of free community events she can attend. I also offered to attend with her if she would like (she took this offer as an insult that she needed ‘supervision’).    \n",
      "•Offering to help her write a resume and cover letter for job applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last night she called me in such a state that I drive to her home in the middle of the night (from 5 hours away) because I was sure she was going to harm herself and the local police station was unmanned for the weekend and I was advised that meant they couldn’t complete a welfare check until Monday morning. I am terrified that she is making an active plan to end her life and that if she attempts it she will probably succeed (the local ambulance response time is a joke and the nearest hospital is over an hour away). I have successfully helped her move through depressive episodes multiple times before but this is different. Both my sister and I am at our wits end and have no idea what else we can be doing or where to turn to. \n",

      "I doubt if she ever saw me as a daughter for once, and not just a mere trophy to boast about. She does not care a crap about my need for privacy, she peeks into my phone, my books, my laptop, and what not, every chance she gets. She constantly hurls curses at me even if something goes minutely wrong or her needs and wants aren't satisfied the way she wanted them to be. She has literally told me in the past that she wished my life was ruined by someone, and I get raped by a vile person who would cheat me. Apart from that, I receive other constant curses like, \"you won't live a good life at all, your life will be terrible, you'll burn in hell, your future will be terrible, and your husband will be a bad man\" (okay, first of all, I'm TERRIFIED of relationships, marriage, or anything that has to do with the romantic paradigm. I've even talked to her about this but she can't help but obsess over me getting married, instead of me having a stable career. What's worse? She has no logical reasoning behind this obsession, and tries to sell me to the same institution {marriage} that ruined her and continues to ruin many others!) She yells at me for trivial things, and absolutely despises it when I even look at a person from the opposite sex - heck, she doesn't want me to even talk to MY OWN FATHER! She constantly feels entitled to just barge into my room to deliver two-hour lectures about how she knows what's best for me, and how I should become the ideal daughter that she pictures in her head - a socially awkward, terrible at communicating, family-oriented yes woman, without any inclination towards her career (and even if so, abysmally little interest must be exhibited). First of all, what a hypocritical thing to believe for a woman who'd been to several countries for work, and secondly, why wouldn't she try to put herself in my shoes FOR ONCE? \n",

      "She ruined my life by forcing me to join a terrible college, despite me getting accepted into better ones - she blackmailed me by playing a whole bunch of cards - my father's hard work card, my life will get ruined if I don't obey her card, I'm only doing good for you card, and what not - just so she could persuade my dad to buy a new apartment in some random suburb village area. Then came her tantrums to move into the suburb, despite owning a good enough home pretty much within the city. She had absolutely no logical reasons to move, and the only back-up she had were her delusions and the curses she hurled at me . Needless to say, she won again (all I asked from her was two years of time for me to move away from her and leave her to her much-wanted peace from me by graduating from college). She has bad blood and beef with almost all of her and dad's relatives, and the only backup she has is her father, who is a much more aggressive despot, who always thinks he's right, and others (esp who are younger and financially more unstable/dependent) do not have a right to question the decisions he imposed on their lives. My father is said to have been a compulsive liar in the past, and he seems to have reformed now, but he feels incredibly helpless in this situation, despite this suburb house being his property. This quarantine has made the situation pretty much worse, and I really want out, but I don't know whom to go to and seek help from. I've been a victim of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse (my mom believes other third party people more than she believes me, and exhibit A: this happened even when I was sexually harrassed by a driving school instructor, from a school SHE put me in). When I question my mother about her incredibly selfish and narcissistic ideals, and pushing me to be what she thinks is human perfection, she just shrugs it off by saying, \"all humans are selfish, and this is human tendency, and hence my selfishness is justified\". I don't know where to go, or what to do, and the worst part is, in the country where I live, you're legally an adult if you're 18, but you're not really an adult, for you don't get a job without graduating, and you definitely don't get affordable houses on rent with the meagre income you'd earn as a pink collared employee. Oh, and there's no \"move out when you're 18\" thing - people usually live with their parents here. \n",

Nothing is going right and even if it was I probably wouldn't acknowledge it. Idk how to get out of this mindset-I have absolutely no urge to change anything, which is what everyone keeps telling me to do. I've tried to look for psychiatrists and psychologist's but its super fucking hard in this mental state and there's a shit ton of steps to just get on the waiting list, and finding someone who takes my insurance etc....

      "Annotations: Hello Reddit. for a little backstory, I'm 15 years old and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over two years ago. It has definitely gotten worse sense then, and I have not talked to a counselor since. Last November, I dropped out of my high school to begin home schooling with a tutor due to social anxiety and my depression hitting a low point. Though I enjoy the environment and freedom that comes with home schooling much better, it does get very lonely. The only people I talk to now are my long distance boyfriend, a couple online friends, and my family (who are very busy with their own work and school) Along with my family being busy, I hardly ever mention my depression to them. If I do, I feel like I'm wasting their time and they'll be disappointed in me. My depression has gotten increasingly worse over the past few months. I've always been skinny, but I've lost a significant amount of weight to the point it's unhealthy. I have no appetite, no desire to do anything, and no one to talk to. With the start of summer, my day consists of laying around and watching TV or playing video games. Even if plans do come up, physical symptoms of anxiety like panic attacks, head aches, and stomach aches typically prevent me from going. My boyfriend wants me to see a counselor, But I'm hesitant because the one I had previously didn't help much, and was very expensive. I worry that by asking my parent's for help, (with my anxiety, depression, and poor eating habits) I'll be wasting their money and time. At the same time, I'm afraid that if I continue to sit here and do nothing I won't live to see my 16th birthday. What should I do? Any tips on getting help and finding meaning and motivation in life at a young age?\n",

      "Annotations: I am a 17 yo male, who comes from an extremely abusive household, and I’ve recently noticed that my feelings are almost non existent. I also can’t feel any pain, some might think it’s a gift but it’s a fucking curse. I’m numb to the core and I just want to be normal again. I haven’t eaten in 3 days because if I try to I throw up. I’ve been getting 4 hours of sleep regularly and can’t physically sleep longer than that. My father used to beat me and force me to torture rodents with him. I remember one time he made me drown a possum in a garbage can and hack a squirrels limbs off. By the time I was 8 years old I had already known how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble a .38 caliber pistol. My father was a narcissist, and I was his golden child. If I ever did anything wrong I was told I was making our family look bad. I’d get a hell of a beating if I even said anything out of line, and my mother was constantly in and out of hospitals from her “accidents”. I believe my father is a large part of why I am feeling the way I am recently. I noticed I stopped feeling emotion when I had a stroke last March. I wasn’t scared, or worried, I was calm, and didn’t even feel anything. Even after I had almost lost my ability to play guitar, I wasn’t sad or scared. Ever since then, it’s just gotten worse and worse. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and all I had to say to her was “ok”. Honestly it was probably best for her, I don’t know if I can feel love anymore, so what’s the point of trying. I recently noticed I can’t physically feel pain when I was trying to fix the shingles on my roof. I missed with the hammer and smacked my hand right on the thumb, but I didn’t feel anything. Just to test my theory, I smacked the back of my hand full force. I heard the crunching of bone, but still felt no pain. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’d say I’m terrified, but I’m not even sure I can feel terrified anymore. I just need help. I’m sorry for how long this paragraph is. I know most of you won’t even read it all, I know I probably wouldn’t. If you did read it all, thank you. I just need help, and at this point in my life I could use any help I can get.\n",

      "I\\[18/F\\]  am having a lot of insecurities, self esteem and confidence issues and I  guess all this started during high school, when I was at the bottom of  the class and i began to feel inferior to my peers and no matter how  hard I tried I still couldn't catch up(I was a straight A student before  high school). and then came college. well, college isn't that bad. I  have always been a very emotional person and I experience a lot of mood  swings. So lately i have been quite down and stressed as I am very  anxious about my career(still clueless). and as a result I haven't been  able to control my emotions. It feels like I'm walking on thin ice and  anyone,literally anyone, can make a small remark and *\\*shatter\\**  and I'm back to drowning in a cold sea of emotions.I spend a lot of  time crying. I just have no control over it. I want to stop crying, i  tell my self to stop crying and i can't and its so goddamn frustrating.  It makes me feel weak(I am already physically weak and underweight). I  know expressing emotions and letting it out is healthy, but what if you  are feeling so emotionally saturated with all the self hate and worries  that you'd cry to anything. I at least wish i had enough control so i  wouldn't cry in front of someone who is not close. but nope. I have zero  control.\n",
      "\n",
      "let me quote this one incident.  a few days ago, I snapped at my elder brother when he was pressuring me  to do learn things for my career. He kept forcing his point and it made  me feel small and incompetent and like he doesn't trust my decisions on  what I wanted to learn so I began to get all defensive and I very  rudely told him off and avoided him ever since. I spent a lot of time  crying and affected by it. And just when I had slowly recovered from it,  a family member on hearing what exactly happened made a remark that \"I  think he's better than you, for the family\" which means that I am too  impulsive and rude and emotional and is bound to create problems in a  family.I still haven't recovered from that. I didn't want to cry,  because my uncle and I don't exactly see eye to eye and I wanted to  disregard this remark and get going with my day. BUT i began to tear up  the next second. I cried for hours.\n",

      "Last year during summer I felt awful, no other way to describe it. Originally I thought it was from the quarantining, not seeing my friends, having to see the really state of the world (that time was a very cold realization to a lot of problems in my country that just left me confused, sad and annoyed), but the more I looked for answers the more confusing it got. I just wouldn't feel better, I'd sleep all day, not have the motivation to do anything I used to like, it was awful. Seeing friends and being around them apparently covered up a lot of what I've been feeling. I spoke to a therapist towards the end of summer and it was pretty obvious I had an actual form of depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "In retrospect it's probably been there for a while. A few years ago I remember random bouts of feeling miserable despite everything in my life seemingly going well, along with it hitting like a truck when things went poorly. Last year I remember not really doing anything I enjoyed, even basic things like turning on a game felt monumental, let along sitting down and drawing something, so for months on end I just didn't. Talking to a friend also made me realize just how far back it went, I don't really remember it at all but he told me about a time in seventh grade where I told him I was depressed. So here I am almost a year after it's been diagnosed, a complete mess. \n",
      "\n",
      "Back to the end of summer, throughout the entire thing i fought with my family a lot, they didn't exactly care for the whole deadly virus thing and kept taking us out to see people. It was really confusing for me, it seemed so simple just wear a mask and stay home for a while to keep other people safe, but here I was arguing with my parents about how we shouldn't be going out. That's when the topic of school opening came up, there was a virtual and hybrid option, I wanted to stay home and they were dead set on getting me back in. That led to a lot of usually hour long arguments with my mom where we went in complete circles, I was just scared and worried for my family's health, but eventually I was sent in to school. \n",
      "\n",
      "Around this time my Grandma passed away, it came out of nowhere and added to the confusion of it all. I've always been accepting of death and everything, but it still hurt a lot to go through. I missed her, and I just had no idea what was going on anymore. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also struggled with intrusive thoughts a lot, something that continues even now. They went from anything as random as questioning my gender to recurring thoughts of suicide, I had absolutely no control of them but them just being there constantly drained a lot out of me. \n",
      "\n",
      "School was rough, none of my friends were in person, meeting new people was really hard with no after school stuff, and teachers clearly weren't having an easy time adjusting to teaching this way. Motivation was hard again, I tried drawing and going outside as much as possible just so I could do something at least, but I didn't feel better. Being at school was just a constant reminder of what position we were all in, I just missed having a normal uneventful year of school at this point. Eventually cases started rising again and I wanted to switch to virtual school again, so yet again I fought with my parents about it every other day. School was miserable, no one was there anymore, no one I knew and none of the familiar faces I didn't, I just wanted to be with my friends at home at least then I could talk to them in class. \n",
      "\n",
      "My memories are fuzzy here but I remember a really bad spiral. I ran out of therapy appointments, it didn't really help anyways and my therapist never really gave me any methods to feel better instead of just trying to do things more. I got swarmed with homework again, having to finish two full art projects and some other things I forgot, but my family was going on a trip over the weekend (at this point I stopped fighting over quarantining it was clear they didn't listen to my concerns) so I wouldn't be able to work on it much. Everything just built up to this point where something as relatively small as having to finish a project just made me snap. The night before the trip I just freaked out, I was a mess of tears and slamming stuff around my room while packing. I remember cutting my finger, I don't know why it's just what I went too, I felt awful after it, it hurt a lot and while it calmed me down I just felt so embarassed and ashamed that I did it. That weekend everytime my finger brushed against something even slightly I just got reminded of what I did to myself, it was horrible. \n",

      "Sometime after or before, I have no idea really, something similar happened. I didn't do a couple of random spanish assignments in school and those appearently counted as quizes without us being told, causing my grade to drop to a solid 30 or 40. Again this was a pretty small problem that was cleared up shortly after but things built up so much that something like this was a breaking point. The night before a big spanish test that would either save or ruin my grade, I was completely overwhelmed again and just broke down, my mom was annoyed I was making noise that late and she kind of just aggressively told me to calm down a bunch but it only got worse. It just all felt so hopeless, but it was the first time in a while that I felt grounded in a way, that I ws actually there presently instead of just going through the motions, but the whole situation hurt. \n",
      "\n",
      "These downward spirals never really got better. Those were the worst examples but the time in between those was filled with me feeling a crushing sense of hopelessness and exhaustion constantly. I was tired of it all, I was overwhelmed to the point where small mishaps with homework could break me. This continued for months, I just felt awful constantly it felt like there was always something small that would show up and throw me off again. I remember another break down about two months ago when I was out seeing colleges, I just stayed up awake for hours one night crying to myself and venting to some friends. Something about how I tried to hard to have things be better, I spent so long trying to draw, and write and do everything that I enjoy while balancing school but it just wouldn't work, it kept getting worse instead of better. I was just tired, I just wanted it to stop, I just wanted to be happy but it only got worse. It felt like there was no reason for any of this, I was just here feeling like shit for no reason, I wanted it to end so badly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Around this time the school announced their full time in person plan, leaving my parents and me too fight about whether or not I should go back in to school. The same arguments happened and eventually I was sent in again. The first day back was some of the most intense anxiety I've ever felt, just pure feer and overwhelmingness about the very uncomfortable situation I was in. \n",
      "\n",
      "That leads me to now, the most recent random period of stress that makes me finally say I can't do this anymore. Three weeks ago review for the AP Lit exam started (a standardized test final for a literature class, known for being very poorly designed) and I realized our teacher taught my class next to nothing about literature the whole year and I was on my own to prepare. The whole overwhelming thing happened again, it just felt like my whole life would revolve around this pointless exam for about an entire month, leaving me with no time to do the few things that actually make me happy anymore. That night I went in the kitchen and just held a knife, I just sat on the floor crying for a while, I know I wouldn't do anything but the thought of it alone terrified me. I wanted it to stop, I just wanted this awful string of events to end already, yet whenever I got scared or overwhelmed all I was told was to get through it to summer, but I couldn't. I didn't think I could do it, at this point I was being told it would get better soon for months on end but everything got worse. They said that's just life, there's always something to get in your way but you have to do it regardless, but I couldn't cope with that anymore, I couldn't cope with that awful reality. I just didn't enjoy living anymore, and if it's this bad now as only a highschooler I couldn't imagine myself being older, in an actual work environment where the same problems persisted. I wanted it to end so badly, nothing was improving and the foreseeable future looked awful and stressful. I promised myself that if it got this bad again I'd ask to see a therapist again, it took a couple weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometime towards the end of next week I learned that I was also taking the SAT (another standardized test infamous for not working in the southeast) in about ten days, leaving me with not nearly as much time to prepare as I thought. I broke down completely, preparing for the AP exam took enough out of me alone, but two of them back to back was a death sentence for me. I kept crying over the idea that it got worse again, that whenever I thought I was at rock bottom it just kept going downhill, no mtter what I did I would continue to feel awful about living itself. I laid out a ten day study plan to go through, saying that in ten days it would be over and the better times everyone talked about would finally be here, it hurts to say but I don't think that's happening. I remember the next day where during all of class I lied in bed, not saying a word to the friends I usually talk to all day, it just all felt so hopeless. That night I remember asking my mom to look into therapy again then went upstairs and lied on the floor of my room for a half hour crying and trying to vent out what I was feeling, but everytime I talked about it I was too scared to fully explain to my friends, leaving it coming off as a student wanting to be lazy rather than sheer hopelessness and a severe lack of any will to keep living they it really was. I took the AP exam yesterday on my birthday, it was fine enough but left me wondering why I even did that, why did I go through all that stress and mental fatigue to look kind of good for colleges? I was tired, tired and done with dealing with this. \n",
      "\n",
      "So here I am a year later, lying in bed with no will or motivation to do anything else. Behind on my school work, and vastly unprepared for an SAT coming up in a few days, just wondering when will it be better. I don't want any of this anymore, I just want to sleep, I'm so tired of everything, I've been burnt out for months with no end in sight, why won't I feel better? I have a test for my driver's license coming up next week too, which cause me to again spiral and type all this, when does it end? Will I ever be just content with life? I'm tired of it all, why won't it get better? When will it end? Is there even a way to cope anymore?\n",

      "My ex fiancé decided to added me on snap and make me relive everything until 3 am when I literally just got over a few days ago? It’s been 6 months of radio silence, an email from me, calls with no answer. We were raising my son together his he was 5 months old and we heard nothing from him. His excuse was the same one that he used all throughout our relationship to not be there for us- work is killing him. He owns a pizza restaurant.. and he’s a control freak so he basically does everything himself even though he pays employees then stressed himself out because he’s doing everything and working 16 hours a day. It ended with me asking for 1 hour a week of couple counselling because I know I have issues but he does too and needs to be able to make at least one hour a time a week for his family if it was ever going to work. His message was “ I miss you. happy New Years” and then from there it turned into him going on about his how shitty his life is without me.. even though apparently I was the reason he had no money ever and now it’s the same. I live off of less than half of his income, supporting my son in a two bedroom as opposed to his one bed- and somehow I have savings, even though I do have some bad spending habits ( fast food delivery 😬, and grocery delivery because sometimes I’m too anxious to leave the house and I need to cook for my son). Anyway so that was a mess. And then my friend with benefit that I was falling for.. that I thought maybe felt the same because he was driving an hour to see me, bringing me starbucks, offering to teach me how to drive and cook better, talking about maybe meeting my kid in the future, talking about taking me out clubbing after covid cause I’ve missed out being a young mom with no help; had a New Years party.. didn’t even think to invite me and posted on his snap grinding with some girl 10x hotter than me.. so I hate myself so much for thinking maybe I was special, maybe I meant something to someone in 2020 nope..\n",

Then I try to feel better, make a huge list of assignments coming up and write down how much is each of them worth. I start working on something and feel it is totally pointless. I start watching youtube or the office to feel a bit better and suddenly it is 6 pm. I think that it's already evening, maybe I should go out, get some fresh air. I go out, pickup a friend and smoke a cigarette or two (my friend doesn't smoke). While coming back, I feel the day is almost over and I am basically useless, nothing will change if I get high. I go and buy some marijuana edible (legal), eat it and go back home. I act like I am working while staying high, so my parents won't know. Many times, I just lie that I have a meeting and shut off my door, lie down and masturbate like twice or thrice in a day. As I get high, I also overeat and buy a lot of junk food and chocolates. Then, I spent the rest of the night till 2-3 am doing all this and watching office or Youtube. I feel totally exhausted and go to sleep.

My chances of getting the scholarship are highly dependent on my honours thesis and I seem to be doing a very bad job till now.

My mom on the other hand was informed by the counselor I was recommended to see a therapist and my mom said, her words: \"teens hitting their puberty stage\". The counselor once again pushed the idea of meeting a counselor and had a small heated debate with my mom about it. My mom backed off and said she would meet one and left with me. We got in the car and the first thing my mom mentioned was that I wasn't going to see a therapist.

As already mentioned my cognition turned incredibly bad, I always think I'm dumb and unable to follow conversations, intellectual topics and such.

I still ended up going to the gym for a couple yoga classes hoping it would at least make me feel a bit better, it didn't. I just want to know if this will ever get better?

I feel like (she told me as well) the reason why she can't love me is because of her depression. I told her that im ready to help her anytime and all. But she doesnt want help and really doesnt like it when others help her. She doesnt cry infront of anyone because thats a symbole of weakness she tells me. I really care about her. It even feels like it hurts me more then her to a point. I dont know what to do. And i feel like if i will be there for her that one day she might feel how it is to love somebody.

She isnt Religious, she feels the \"best\" if she is just alone and if she has her quietness. She feels pressured if she is outside with her friends etc.. She also doesn't find relationships appealing. Maybe because she never had a good/real one with feelings but that is just an assumption. She has guilty feelings because she started daiting me and wishes me to find a better one. She doesnt really like herself etc etc. Dont understand me wrong. Outside she is a extrovert, like nobody would know that she is actually depressed im sure. She acts like a woman that is really happy with most things. But some sings i could read told me how she things about certain themes..\n",

At least I have one friend that is really helping with all of this mumbo jumbo. She always makes my day at least ten times better. I am really needing help because I don’t want anything worse than this happening. Every day I feel horrible to wake up, and the whole day I’m just stressing on some random things. I don’t want to be miserable every day :( this is not how I want to live. Someone please help me.\n",

Has anyone experienced this before from my position or even from his that could give me some insight of how their stories progressed with their loved ones as the depression lasted/or while you or they got help?

Why? because they're my family, and I thought it would matter to them that I, their son, was suffering so genuinely, in so much pain and doubt. When I was so lost and confused and desperately reaching out to them, they fucking turned their back on me. Or so I felt, back then and I still do. I felt so betrayed that the people I loved and trusted the most in the world would do that so I became bitter and made a promise to myself that I'd never share my life with them again. I acted out, maybe in an attempt to punish them, to get back at them for not caring. I just let myself go, let my life collapse little by little. Years have passed now and I honestly think I've never been able to really give up hope that my family would be there for me, as if they would just suddenly drop whatever they're doing and come to my side, telling me that they care and that we'll  make this right. Now, as much it pains me to acknowledge it, I don't  think that's  ever going to happen. I just attempted to talk to my mother for the first time in months about my depression and she immediately got up and left the room. I feel like I should be undamaged by this by now, and I want to tell myself I'm fine after that, but I feel so alone in this world and stupid for thinking that she'd care enough to want to listen. This is all the more crushing because we're  on a family trip which I did not want to come to initially, but after we got here, I felt things that I hadn't  felt for a long time, that I thought I'd never feel again. Something made me want to get my life together and do things. So in the process of thinking about what I'd like to do after this trip, the events I mentioned happened. I honestly feel very hopeless and my will to live has dwindled close to none. Should I just give up on my seemingly unrealistic dreams and expectations of a loving caring family and move on? It hurts my heart. so much. but seems like the only way to do anything with my life. Do I move on? for what? Myself? It just doesn't seem a good enough reason.

I've always been too obsessed about the way i look, i think in a pathological level, avoided meetings because a felt ugly, don't eat or eating way too much, etc, so that's why i think this situation feels particularly hard. About a two months ago i thought i had a cavity in my tooth (i don't know the word in english for \"caries\"). I stopped smoking. I went to the dentist, it wasn't that, she cleaned my teeth, but i was feeling like my four frontal teeth are moving, she said they don't move but i feel it. She said i have bruxism so maybe it's that, but i literally can't eat because i feel that movement and it driving me nuts. I used to wear braces when i was a teenager, now days i need them again, and i can't look at the mirror. I want to go back in time. I'm crying all day, i don't eat, i constantly think about killing myself because thats just my life, everything goes the worst way it can go since always. I don't have money to go to therapy, i tried to talk to people but they don't take me serious and say i \"should stop bother them\". My boyfriend really tried to make me feel better but nothing worked and i knew he felt frustrated and i think angry because of the way i talk, so i started to act like everything is ok. Today my mom said i was skinny and i felt like crying because i know it is because i feel so terrible. I used to love my teeth, they were the only thing i liked about myself, i used to love smiling, now I'm crying all day, feeling stressed, thinkin about killing myself.

His depression has manifested itself in pushing me away, anger and hostility towards me, I believe as a defense from trauma in his childhood that has been re-triggered in the past few years.  I am basically his scapegoat for everything wrong in his life.  He also is distant, wont talk, and uses TV and books as an escape (which are at thankfully healthy) but spends considerable time in them. I would love ANY solid advice on how to navigate this.  How can I best love him through this?  Especially if his instinct right now is to push me away.  Any “do’s or don’ts?”  Can I leave affirmations / encouragement for him in the form of notes?  This is killing me slowly inside.  I miss my friend.  He is such a fantastic guy and I feel as if he has been swallowed by a dark cloud.  Also to note we are in the beginnings of couples counseling.

      "However - I have always been someone who was very lacking female contact. My whole life whenever I had female friends it was something very special to me and mostly those friendships were more important to me than to them. Always wanted to have a \"best female friend\" but after years where this wish never came true I gave up on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "At the moment I mainly have contact to two of my female friends. One is my ex girlfriend and we message each other occasionally. I know that she's very busy so naturally it's rare for her to message me. But when we chat then it's always very fun for both of us and we have a great time. And then nothing for like 1 or 2 months. I sometimes tell her how I'm very happy when she messages me and stuff and then she always insists that it's so rare because she has no time. So I can kinda cope with it.   \n",
      "Then there's another (online) friend who I have known for roughly two and a half years now. We once were really close and even planned to meet up once but then quarantine hit and then the plan kinda fell into the water. Somehow the contact got less and less until it started again about a year ago. Mainly when it's her or my birthday we keep saying how we should get into a voice call again and play some games like we used to. But then again when I ask her later she either says \"yeah we should do that soon\" or when she says \"I guess it could work out tonight\" she does not cancel it but at the same time I cannot reach her and the next day she says stuff like \"Sorry didn't work out\". I'm a very understanding person so I can easily accept that. However when you have planned something I think it should be your duty, if you post pone it, to message that person again and make a new plan. That doesn't happen. Last time she cancelled the plan nearly two weeks ago and I haven't heard from her since. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have social anxiety and even though that got a lot better during the last years it can still be an awful big challenge for me to message someone on my own (especially if I really care about that person). In these cases I can overcome myself after some time but it seems to be me doing the work way too often. Something you got to know is that I'm someone who likes to live for the good of others. I love to do stuff for my friends and make them happy. When my friends are happy, so am I. But obviously in a friendship there's always two parts.  \n",
      "All I would want is an occasionally message from these people who are so important to me. Just a simple thing that makes me realize that at least in that very moment I was in their thoughts. Show me that you thought of me and I'm the happiest person. But leave me in the dark for weeks and I fall into  a big hole. \n",
      "\n",
      "Worst thing is that there are so many people who talk to me daily and who show that they care about me daily. And even though I'm surrounded by so many people close to me I still feel lonely simply because the desire in my heart for these other friends have a whole different weight. I feel bad to feel lonely because I have no need to. Because I know that there are many people who would love to have what I do. I'm a very emotional person and I can hardly cope with pain like this. Sometimes I ask them why we don't message each other more often. And days after that we do, but then it stops again. Then it feels like they only did it because I asked them to. So I practically did the work again and it thus it makes me feel worse than before. \n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously I know that we aren't as close as we once were. I know that they are probably busy with life (I'm unemployed so I'm trapped with my thoughts very often) and that they have other people closer to them who they (probably) rather spend time with. But I don't see how it is hard work to think about my friends at least once in some weeks. Maybe stuff like that is way more important to me than to others. I know that I love myself and who I am and that's why it's even harder for me to understand this. Am I doing something wrong? Are my expectations too high even though, in my opinion, they're pretty much as low as they could possibly get? Am I just knowing the wrong people?    \n",
      "This is not something that gets me down on a regular base. It's more like a phase that lasts for a couple of hours and then I'm fine again. But lately this has occured more often and for longer periods of time. And obviously this affects my daily life as well because once I'm depressed I mostly just sit there and don't know what to do with my time. Everything suddenly seems boring. Even though one simple message (for example, it's not like this is the only thing that causes me to get depressed) would potentially fix it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for this essay. I'm not a native speaker so there could be some mistakes. But I do hope that at least someone takes the time to read through it and give me an honest opinion what I should do. How do you think I can convice them to think about me more often? It honestly seems like begging to me and I would rather avoid that. I just want the heartache to stop...\n",

      "Annotations:  Please listen and don't downvote me. I've been facing severe depression and anxiety for about 8 years now. Needless to say, it's been dreadful. I finally sought professional help in the form of psychiatrist. Turns out his meds made things worse. Then after some years, I thankfully found a good psych who did make a difference. The difference is this: I became more 'functioning'. That's it. The inner turmoil is still very much there. I've been to multiple therapists (Mind you, we're talking about the most well renowned and expensive therapists in my region) but it just made no positive change at all. We went at lengths to discuss and dissect me and my life and my behaviors and my emotions. All this 'analysis' increased my overthinking to the point that now my mind constantly thinks and is aware of each and everything. Like 'hey you did this because of xyz feeling'. Its painfully exhausting. It's like a constant 24/7 commentary in my mind, which was fueled by the therapy. After each therapy session, I felt ashamed, guilty, and worthless. So much negativity about me. Reinforcing the idea that there is something gravely 'wrong' with me. Never did I feel validated at therapy. Never was I told what I can do to feel better. It was like talking to a mirror. Just reflecting back what I said. Which quite frankly, I dont need to hear as my mind has been chattering all those things for years now.\n",

      "Annotations: I’m turning 30 next year and I’m the biggest fuck up I know. I’ve been all my life thinking I had a great future ahead as I was a better-than-average student, my parents let me choose the career I wanted (even if it was an economic risk/I’m majoring in arts), went through college very competently, got good grades but I also was inadvertently sabotaging myself. I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a teenager, my parents were told I might have a mental disorder such as an anxiety disorder or BPD. I went to a psychiatrist for a whole year but dropped out since I wasn’t feeling any different and decided to instead focus on school. But being honest I never truly made an effort in school. Many professors told me I was talented but I was always so afraid to prove them wrong so I did no major projects. I kept avoiding major job opportunities since I thought those weren’t for me and I wasn’t the right guy for them. My “professional” life had a shine of light at the beginning of 2020 as one of my projects was being financed, then the pandemic hit putting everything on hiatus, got no job of course, and had to go back to my parents. One year later: everything’s worse. Still jobless, still with my parents, procrastinating, hitting bottom every couple months, with 3 suicide attempts already, and just shitty thoughts every passing hour. My parents are sick of me even if they don’t say it out loud. I’m sick of myself. I’m a fucking parasite too scared to do anything to change that. To move back to my apartment and find a job. To see how accomplished my friends are and seeing what they’ve done in the past year and me thinking “good for you mate, I just tried killing myself more than once haha”. I’m too ashamed. \n",
      "I’m too old now. I see people being successful at 24 and I’m 29 now and it’s too fucking late, still living off my parents is so humiliating. I can’t shake away that feeling and I’m so afraid one of these days that feeling turns unbearable and just end me without thinking it twice. I’m done.\n",

Appreciate it if y'all could share with me your thoughts. To start off, I have both anxiety and depression. I know that with those 2, it definitely would be a roller coaster ride with my emotions and I am familiar with this as it is like a cycle that I kept having to go through. I would say that my depression is not as severe as my anxiety though. So back to my main story.   \n",

      "Recently I have been busy trying to help a suicidal friend.  I have known her for 7 years plus and am aware that she was suffering from depression. I always thought that it was going to be okay as time goes by but then I realized it worsened. She was really going all out on ending her life that I had to call the police on her. Thing is, she has been planning out her will and settling whatever she considered as necessity for the preparation of her demise. Its like i am scared but I have no choice to take charge as she does not have a good r/s with her family.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I managed to persuade her to go and seek help from the professional. She was adamant but somehow agreed eventually. First medication didn't work so we changed to another type. End up, she decided to stop taking the medication all by herself. She went MIA for about a week or so. When she finally texted, it was bad news - she was prepping to end her life. I had to call the police on her. Apparently she lied to them that she was okay and would be attending her appointment, so they couldn't do anything (in my country the police can only intervene if you are caught in the act of committing suicide). However later on she berated me as she felt that I had betrayed her. She however continued to confide in me. I was pretty much unsure what to do so I wrote a letter to the family secretly (I know where she stays and i made sure to text her mum that I had put a letter outside their house gate). They eventually texted back to express their gratitude but I did not hear from them afterwards...   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So again, she had her bouts of episode and meltdowns and I had to calm her down every single time. it gets exhausting for me as well. And I always feel that I am trying to fight against absorbing and feeling down from all of these. Recently, she went for a staycay and her mum called me. She was begging me to ask my friend to cancel it to which i have no influence on at all since my friend was  really optimistic about this (she initially had plans to kill herself during this trip but after meeting another psychologist, she kind of is delayin it). When her mum called me a second time, i was with my friend and my friend was really on the edge. She tried taking my phone away from me to talk to her mother but I stopped her. Her mum SAID thru the phone \"since i didn't know she is with you and you are still going to allow her to go for the staycay, ALL is on you. YOU SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF SMTG HAPPENS TO HER. I DONT CARE but you make sure she is safe.\" I was quite upset by this but politely ended the call as my friend tried grabbing the phone away from me.  Ended up, she called her mum back only to shout and scream at her mum - berating the mum for calling me. Her mum was upset. The mum texted me and blamed me for my friend's action. I replied to her saying I was sorry that that happened and that I tried calming my friend but she went hysteria instead. The mum later replied telling me that since my friend does not listen to her as a mother, i should be the one doing the advice and guiding my friend to the so called 'right path'. She said that she leave me to take care of my friend for her.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Im speechless guys.. I am so exhausted already but yet this happened?? It felt like the mum is just giving up on her daughter?? I fr am so lost on what i should do. Becos tbh, Im also slowly going back into depression and some of my friends has been trying to contact me but I am trying to get away from everyone. I know im burntout but i really feel like shit. I am jobless and im trying to move on with my life but i have to be on my toes in case my friend kills herself. FYI i have since stopped seeing my therapist becos i wanted to focus fully on this friend. I also have called different hotlines available online but lets be real - they kept telling me to call the police when she is in danger. Like I want to know what else I can do y'know. Not like just sit there and wait for her to act on it. I rather understand how I can communicate and try to deflect negative feelings when I'm dealing with her. And yet her mum says this kind of things??? Was I at fault?? Was i wrong??? So im begging y'all, pls lmk what i can do. Thanks in advance!\n",

Two years ago, it turns out it was a misdiagnosis and it was atypical ADD (no hyperactivity, just the concentration and motivation issues), and I've been properly medicated since. I've had ECT (electroshock) twice, before the ADD diagnosis. My current therapist is excellent, and tells me that compared to how I was when I first started seeing her (almost 9 years ago) I'm so far beyond where I was that it's astounding. I guess what I'm saying is, I've been lucky in that I've been able to take advantage of mental health resources, and what I'm experiencing isn't due to a lack of those.\n",

The test was a four-hour ordeal that literally involved, at one point, blood streaming down my face as I fought a marine twice my size (they paused it for a few minutes so I could clean myself up). When they announced the results a few days later, I didn't feel pride, or accomplishment. I just felt imposter syndrome: I didn't deserve it, they must have made a mistake, they made it for political reasons and not based on my skill, etc.\n",

      "My current therapist says it has something to do with not being taught how to appreciate things - how to connect with that feeling of appreciation. Essentially, a deep feeling of not-being-good-enough means I don't let myself feel the emotional rewards of anything until I feel I've \"earned it\", which thanks to the feeling, never happens. She's probably on to something, but no matter the situation, I can't seem to make those connections, even if I can act on them.\n",

I don't have anyone that I tell news to when things happen - I've tried, but all my friends always seem weirded out by my sharing. When I do talk to my friends, it's brief conversations about shared interests, so always surface level stuff. My wife is incredible, but we're so completely different. We have almost no common interests, have basically opposite personalities, and even our ways of talking are so different that we constantly misunderstand each other, so giving each other the support we need is difficult and foreign. I honestly can't explain why we have the bond that we do, but it is genuine, and despite the differences the marriage is strong, and despite not being able to feel it, we know we love each other and are loved ourselves.\n",

      "My social skills are, without hyperbole, autistic. I myself am not autistic, but conversations are impossible for me. I never know what to say, unless prompted. Someone says \"How are you?\" and I say \"Good, you?\" and they respond. If they don't say anything else, I don't know how to continue the conversation. I sit in awkward silence. I've asked someone how they are three times in a row before. I know I'm supposed to say something, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is. I see other people do it with ease, but it's always just... \"how did you know to say that thing you said?\"\n",

      "The break-up was the fist time I choose my own needs above someone else’s and it felt like a step towards freedom. Meanwhile I’m kinda dating somebody I have an extremely strong connection with. We’ve had a short but intense relationship in the past but lost connection. We started talking again right before I finally decided to breakup with my ex (I’ve considered it many times but never had the courage to actually do it). I strongly believe that talking to this person made me decide to breakup with my ex. Besides that it really feels/felt like the universe wanted us to connect again in a romantic way. We’ve been dating for the past 2,5 weeks and I’ve never been this confused in my life.\n",
      "One day I feel so liberated, loved, happy and absolutely in love with the person I’m dating. The next day I’m full of guilt, confused about my feelings for my ex and extremely depressed again. Guilt because I feel like I’ve done my ex wrong while I know I didn’t. Our relationship was not equal and mainly based on me taking care of him financially and emotionally. I feel like I abandoned him and I hate myself for that. Confused because I miss him so much and still feel love for him and the person I’m currently dating, both in a romantic way. Depressed because I don’t know how to deal with these feelings and because I think I messed up again. I feel like my life is a constant pattern of failure and making bad decisions unconsciously. I’m stuck and lost. \n",

I know I tend to start difficult and ambiguous relationships in order to avoid other complicated feelings I actually have to deal with (like a breakup). I’m very aware of my coping but at the same time I feel like I genuinely need to experience if a relationship with the person I’m dating will work out or not. I’m pretty sure I will be devastated if it doesn’t but that doesn’t keep me from trying. \n",

I’m very aware of everything that’s happening but at the same time I’ve no idea what’s going on (mainly emotionally). I can’t function properly, I sleep a lot and have no appetite. I only feel energetic when I’m with somebody else but when I’m alone I just feel physically and emotionally drained. There’s so much going on in my head that I just end up with an empty and zombiefied mind. My anxiety is getting worse and I have nightmares every night. I don’t see the meaning or function of life because it never seems to get better. I’m not suicidal but I’m just done with this constant sequence of negative events and emotions. I just want to live a happy and stable life. \n",

We actually met from a online hook up at the beginning and he ended up staying here for a few nights, but after a week when I asked him for a date he said he wanted to stay friends as that was more important. I still remember how much it broke my heart then when he rejected me, but we hung out nearly every day. He stayed at my place most of the time and we just became really close. We sleep together whenever we stay at each other’s places, just cuddling. Over the years I have fallen deeper for him and I had already suffered with my own mental health before all this but now I feel so torn.\n",

      "Annotations: Since about November 2019 I’ve started to experience symptoms of depression but i just thought it was some sort of phase or something since I’m just a teenager but its now Jan 2021 and those symptoms have constantly been in my brain like they have almost become apart of me. Plus I’ve started to experience a few symptoms of depersonalization disorder but once again it’s only a few and usually I only feel the symptoms to this when I'm doing stuff I know my parents would yell at me for. For example one time I smoked weed with some people and In the moment I knew I shouldn't do it and but I felt like telling myself no was just like watching a movie and trying to tell the actor not to do something but what ever you say you can't change the outcome. I didn't get caught but that whole time I felt like I was just on autopilot. Idk if either of my cases could even be diagnosed because I only have a few of the symptoms (but these symptoms are persistent) but not all that are required to actually have the disorder. I feel like these stem from emotional abuse but once again i feel like the “abuse” is not like super bad but its there. Like I’m consistently told I’m the cause of stress in my house and  I get yelled at for the littlest things but then an hour later they’ll give me a hug and forget it ever happened ( this happens everyday). I have a sense of isolation from my family like I live with them but I'm like an outsider that doesn't belong. Also I feel like I'm forgetting how to be myself like I'm usually considered the funny guy or that guy just always knows how to have fun that's but like recently I've noticed A LOT more of my jokes are missing and me being excited or funny comes off as trying too hard. I don't really know what I’m asking for just any advice?\n",

I almost convinced myself to delete this but I mean there's no harm in seeing what people have to say I guess.\n",

      "Annotations: So basically at the beginning of the year I started slitting my wrist because I started feeling overwhelming depression after 2019. My mum saw the marks and told me to stop. At the beginning of quarantine my depression took another increase, and for two days I started slitting my wrist (again) until my mum saw. She demanded that I tell her what was wrong, and I just told her I feel generally depressed (all the reasoning behind it is complicated and plus I don't feel comfortable telling her). She asked me if a boyfriend had broken up with me or something, and that definitely wasn't the reason (so I assume if she knows I'm depressed she'll think that). She then demanded that I don't slit my wrists again, and therefore I know that if I do, I'll get into a bunch of crap I don't wanna be in. I really wanna start doing it again; I'm a horrible person (so I deserve it) and hurting myself makes me feel better for some reason. I've always felt guilt and shame, and self hatred, and I feel like my life has reached 'the end of the line'; I feel true happiness has faded, and the realisation has struck, that life is completely worthless and I will die one day, leaving everything behind. All motivation seems gone, and my life has just gone to shit, comparing it to the past. I really want to slit my wrist, but I know my parents would see. So what do I do? How do I cut myself and 'get away with it'? Can I cover it up without raising suspicion? I really want to. I feel desperate, but I know I can't.\n",

I don’t feel like I was ever raised; I think I was only ever “baby sat”. I don’t understand why my family never gave me away to someone who would have loved me?

I remember living with family members and only having two outfits and at a young age I was forced to wash my own clothing because no one would do it for me. I have no choice but to think back at these times when looking for advice and support because I never have had anyone. My mom thought she was doing a deed to keep me away from my father as a child; now I’ve grown up to have no one. I resent her for it.

Iam just waste of flesh, i should have been aborted, and no iam not just in this *mood* at the moment, that's how I always feel, I realized it a long time ago but there is just not a cure for my *hate*  *jealousy* and whatever sin from the Bible I embody. If God exists and if he truly punishes those who deserve it, than why am I not already dead. Also why can't I change, why was I born this way, why was I bullied so hard in high school, why am I gay, why could I never experience love till now? Just end me so that no one has to deal with me anymore.\n",

      "Annotations: So I’m 15 and for most of my life I’ve been treated not badly but like I’m really different as if there were something wrong with me  (pretty much only in school since kindergarten). Other than that I’ve always been a happy kid with a great sense of humour but in the last few years since becoming a teen things have crashed down on me. I believe it was 2015 my close nan (my mums side, ill get to why that’s important later) was diagnosed with dementia (other nan lives on a farm outside my town where she barely sees anybody). In 2017 my cat that I had only had for about 5 years (when he came to my doorstep seemingly only a few weeks/months old) suddenly died from chest cancer and I felt sad mainly because I didn’t have much to do with him even though I loved him so much. Although I have had a few pet losses this hurt me for a few months (tear down my face as I’m writing this). The main reason it was so bad was how a normal day turned into hearing he was unable to move when my Aunty went home for a break, and that later turned into the vet saying he should be put down. On to the next crack in my life. Only a few weeks before I was born my dad died (I still don’t have it in me to sit with my mum and have that conversation on how it happened), and although I don’t feel sad about not having him as I’m used to it since birth, I have heard things about fatherless kids not having as good lives (although I am being co raised by my Aunty who is pretty much a 2nd mother except she can be giving the fatherly tough love some times). There has also been drama including my other Aunty doing drugs and making our life harder (I will say I don’t think it is intentional but her stupid choices are messing us all up). There’s heaps more I can talk about like my addiction to games even when I’m not enjoying them and the recent passing of artist xxxtentacion (I know he’s a very controversial person but I really enjoyed his music and just seeing his face and hearing his messages to his fans). I’m failing at school since year 8 and I’m always feeling worried about how I went in a test or having 1000 bricks on my chest scared what my mum will say when she sees how I went. I spent the entire 2nd half improving and trying my best especially in English where my teacher would repeatedly remind me I’m an intelligent kid but I’m just lazy, and when I thought I had improved I went from the first semester being all C’s and turned it into C’s and one D. I can’t focus on anything important in class, I can’t remember stuff and it feels like everything I’ve explained in this post is coming together and ruining my life, making me feel hopeless and giving me a feeling of life being pointless. My ideal life right now would be one where I can stay home all day without worrying about any responsibilities or having to deal with my peers or school. Being around people seems to make me feel more lonely. Being around family im almost always happy. Avoiding all of these things feels like it would make me feel great again even though me in my right mind would’ve hated the idea of being alone at home all day with my “boring” parents. I don’t know what to do. I want to see a doctor deep down but i also don’t want to know if there’s something wrong, I don’t want to do the whole medication and therapy thing. I just want to be a normal kid who can be happy and out there like I used to be. I’m sorry for talking so much but I just wanted to let it all out and ask if people think these are signs that I should seek help. Maybe if there’s anybody going through something similar to me who has been diagnosed. Any sign to help me know what’s wrong with me because I want to seek help but I don’t want to tell my parents about it and have them tell me I’m just going through the teenage stage of life, and then have a doctor tell me the same and make me look and feel even worse. At this point I don’t know what I’m talking about but I just don’t want to keep feeling like this. If this isn’t depression then I don’t know what to do because I don’t want to have to deal with this horrible feeling in my body anymore.\n",

I’ve been diagnosed with depression since I was 16 when I first had these thoughts hit me in a big way and I’m 27 now. Zoloft has always helped, but I’ve been bad about my meds for the last year or so so I’m having a relapse, I get this. But the thing is, the stuff I’m worrying about feels so real. These aren’t “I’m bad,” or “no one loves me,” or “I want to hurt other people” thoughts. They’re on a deeper, simpler level. Sometimes I wonder if I’m being treated for depression when I’m actually just seeing the truths of existence clearer than a lot of other people else and that makes me feel hopeless that I’ll ever feel better. Like the system might not be equipped to help me. It makes me so sad.\n",

I WILL eventually cease to exist. All the stuff I care about is just electricity and matter and chrmicals in the brain telling me I care about stuff. The “I” isnt even necessarily real, it’s just a collection of smaller parts. I  know that the classic reddit atheist way of getting through this stuff is just saying life is what you make of it, but when really confronted by the seeming truth that the self will disappear when we die, I guess it just rings kind of hollow. Like, yes of course I love my girlfriend and our pets and my parents and my friends, and I love to make art and perform, I want to go to grad school and get married and have kids. And doing that stuff makes me feel great! But lately I’ve just been under this cloud of “none of this has purpose even if you pretend it does.” Like, I’ll feel great doing these things and then I’ll think “that was nice, but I’m going to forget that it happened and cease to exist eventually.” Ugh. The whole thing makes life feel unreal and dreamlike. \n",

      "Annotations: I'm 22 years old who currently struggling with film thesis in my senior year. My thesis's topic is hard and it's stressing me out. And I found this community where you draw a character and role-playing with other's character in some sort of setting like MMORPG. So I decided to use it to escape from some stress from my works. But it turned worsen. I have no friends there and it's like everyone is knowing each other. I know the fact that I didn't active much because of my works and I'm kind of confident in my drawing and painting skill (I'm part-time freelance artist.)  But nobody played with me or make their character talk to mine. I got anxious so I tried to please everyone by praising their characters in introduction posts or asking for our interactions of our own chars. Some didn't reply my message. In the last 5 days, I got sleepy entire day, lost an appetite, I only ate a small meal or snack once in a day and insomnia. I felt left out. So I brought my account to follow their public account with feeling that If I befriend with them maybe they'll be interact with me ? Some of them turned out fine. But there's one who seemed to hate me because stupid me had bad choice of words when complimented their char. At first, they didn't know I'm the owner of that char, they seemed happy enough but once they knew the truth, they seemed off and didn't talk to me since. I know it's stupid to give a damn about mimicking world where those members came from wherever in the world. But it's so stressing when you feel like talking to a brick and everyone treats you like an air. Please say something, I really need support :(\n",

A family member choosed to not talk with me anymore, December should have been anniversary day w. my ex + it reminds me of my sad little family, not so many friends and two earlier suicide tempts (another ex + a dear friend). So Dec in general is a REALLY tough month for me. I went on the sick leave this Dec, because it just became to much.I then called ST to tell her about my choice - also telling her that earlier this year I was so depressed, that I tried to take my own life. But that I'm not there anymore, but fear to end there if I don't take myself seriously. She got mad and told me that being on the sick leave is the most stupid thing ever - because I was ALMOST recovering, and almost starting up my own business etc.I got angry and told her that I just needed my friends to believe in me - and believe me when I said that this choice was the right one for me. And hearing others concerns doesn't help me - but just feeds my anxiety about not pleasing anyone. She got irritated and told me she's allowed to have an opion.- I never told her she's not allowed to. But sometimes she can't see what's proper to tell someone who's having a hard time.\n",

      "One week after, she broke the bond to a mutual friend who's also on the sick leave.He's much much worse than me. Still ST took everything personal and got angry.

I have trust-issues and now fear any moment what ST thinks - I usually please her. This is what the mutual friends also did, and this turned out bad.\n",

Telling her I'm fine and that I'll get back. Can she just leave me the f\\*\\*\\* alne and believe that I'm doing fine, taking one small step at a time. THIS is one of the reasons why I had to take a break from people. If I believe in their concern about me not getting better, I won't be better. The last time my dad told me he though I would kill myself - I wasn't having some selfharming thoughts. But then I started having them - just to prove that he was right. I won't let this selfdestructive way of pleasing get in touch with me again. And being away from people, only having contact with my mom, has changed my habits into being able to wake up, going outside, making food (once in a while) and start to work on my traumas.But know, because of her messages, I fear I get stuck in the believe of not recovering. I know it's not her wish, but that's how it affects me... My therapy sessions is mainly about relations. I don't understand them and this is also why I need to start the therapy alone and then, slowly this or the next month, I will begin to open up again and see some friends again.\n",

He said he didn't think things would ever work between us and he doesn't love me the same way anymore. I am devastated, I've gone between crying, sobbing, sleeping, and thinking how to kill myself. I just never want to feel like this again, I don't want anyone to be able to hurt me. I don't do well socializing because I'm afraid if I open up people won't accept me or are going to hurt me. He was the only one I thought I could trust. He's left it open to being friends, but all I can think about is how he's not mine anymore and I'll never be able to kiss or hug him the same way again. I was desperate and talked to him today because I felt like I needed him, it didn't turn out well. Other than him and his friends I don't have a lot of friends. I'm part of a friend group but I'm not really close with any of them and they have kicked me out of the group before for not being active enough.

What does bother me is that my Dad’s 70th birthday is just a reminder to me that I don’t have much time left with him. At most another 10 years and that’s optimistic.  It just makes me so fucking sad beyond words to even think about. My Dad is my favorite person in the world and I can not even comprehend living a single day without him. I just wish so bad that I could be like every other fucking person and have a young Dad so I could have some more time with him. I truly don’t know what I’ll do when he passes. With how old he is, it feels like there’s really no way of knowing, when. It makes me sick to even think about it. but the hard reality is is that he could really die this year even. Or he could miraculously live until 100. But deep down I know that I have less than 10 years with him and it FUCKING KILLS ME.\n",

I tried this morning to reach out.... I got blocked, I'm not really a person with much friends but I usually just talk to my irl friends on social media. It helps to have someone to talk to, but now I have no one. No one really cares about me or checks up on me, I'm mostly talking about my friends about this, my parents sometimes check up.

And it’s not like I’m a bad son, I’m actually better than most teenagers because I have straight A’s and because I have no supportive friend group that would invite me to things I don’t drink or do drugs or have sex. I genuinely feel like the society around me has gone insane (at least the place I live has). \n",

I don't want to get much into detail but up until some months ago relationship was great, then we started having some minor issues, which bummed me out a little. I never told her about it: it's no big deal, I can't justify being mad about this little thing... I thought. Of course you can figure that these minor issues only began to grew, pushed us apart and ultimately killed the relationship. When we recently talked about this it was already too late, but upon openly talking about the matter I understood her behaviour much better. Probably, if we had talked about that way sooner we could have saved the relationship.\n",

Again, I never told her about it nor decided to take the step myself. This is probably because I don't have many friends and fear solitude. There are a lot of times already when I feel lonely, especially during the latter months, and I didn't want to make matters worse. However, I am almost sure that having this constant break up thought made me unconsciously sabotage the relationship and be more distant. Of course, talking about this stuff earlier on would have probably helped.\n",

Most of my human interactions feel fictitious, most I get lately are from work (not real friendships). I can go entire weekends home alone without no one contacting me, thus, feeling lonely. I am mostly an introvert, I once saw a post of another fellow introvert that said the best days of his life where when an extrovert \"adopted\" him. Never a post has spoken so much to me.\n",

I get embarrassed when I get emotionally involved into a conversation, I hate the thought of making my mental health an excuse, but sometimes I just feel like I just ran a marathon, I lay down and I can’t help but cry because of such a failure my life is and how weak I am.\n",
      "I have an abusive father, my family and I tried everything to solve problems and help him change but he won’t listen to anyone. Our family is pretty much divided to responsible men (my oldest brother and my father) and women that should do everything around the house so everyone else, especially my father, can live comfortably. I have five siblings. Since I’m the oldest girl I’m expected to be the major housekeeper except my mom. I’m also the one with the most sense of being fair and respectful towards what I have and what’s given to me, that’s why I rarely skip my responsibilities or deny any request or help. I feel overwhelmed about the amount of stuff I need to do, not to mention the way my parents treat me when something is not done perfectly.\n",
      "I graduated high school with average results, I’m neither the smartest nor the dumbest person on earth. I don’t have any specific abilities nor passions to pick a solid university major that would make me happy and open a career path that would let me sustain myself. Now that I can apply to college, my score is slightly beyond the minimum. I picked a major about Korea, the country and the language, it’s something I got interested in, I am studying Korean for a while. But when I realized how much points you have to have to get accepted I lost any excitement that I had, I barely meet the requirements, most people have tens of points more. I don’t stand out in any way.\n",
      "I was never liked at school. I felt like outsider wherever I went. Nobody was ever in love with me. I never had a friend, first people that I started to hangout with I met a year ago. For majority of my life I was overweight, at some point I was even obese. I lost over 50lbs (23kg) a year ago and I do everything to maintain my weight on a healthy level. I have to be focused on what I eat, I gain weight in the matter of days. Every cheat day feels like one step closer to my past self. My relationship with food is extremely bad and I don’t know how to change it.\n",
      "I don’t fit anywhere. I don’t feel good in any place, I shout my mouth around people for them not to be forced to hear about my problems that sometimes spill out through my mouth unintentionally.\n",
      "Who would want to be around with such a loser for longer anyway?\n",
      "I met a boy online, after a couple of months we became really good friends. We always have something to talk about, we share so many experiences and he respects me and wants only good for me. I had a hard time with men because of my father, I never believed they would value me or they would use me quickly after getting along. But this guy showed me that there are good men out there, with a softer side and responsible mind. After talking and calling each other for a longer time I realized how safer and calmer I feel now that he’s in my life. Even unconsciously I feel his gentle presence. Now I think that I realized what does love mean and that I have feelings for him. He’s from a different country though. I was saving up for plane tickets and the trip there, I started planning everything in March and look, it’s July and nothing happened. Even though I was researching all the legal information, translating documents, buying necessary things, keeping myself updated on flights, I’m still here. And I have no idea if I will ever get there. There are too many obstacles.\n",
      "I can’t tell anyone about it besides my friend himself, nobody thinks here that online relationship can be real, if it’s either just friendship or a spark of love. It’s too dangerous and too much risk involved. Can’t disagree, but I don’t think it’s true in our case. Even though it’s been a year, we’re exchanging pictures and we made phone calls and the risk still exists, but it’s limited, but they don’t even want to think about it.\n",
      "And whoever had someone dear to their heart away for long know how much it hurts when you can’t even see them smiling in real life or hug them when they need it.\n",
      "I’m a failure. No job, no university perspectives, not a lot of money, best friend 1300 miles away.\n",
      "Nobody takes my emotional exhaustion seriously, it’s not even a valid argument anywhere. Usually even I don’t believe it is.\n",
      "I have not the slightest idea what to do with my life. There’s too much pressure on me and I can’t take it anymore. I feel like completely giving up. I was meant to be lonely. My life is just meant to be miserable.\n",

      "Annotations: Just graduated High School May 2019 and turned 19 at then end of September but now that I'm finally done with school whats next for me? Working as a slave for 50 years? Or putting myself thousands of dollars behind just to go to college setting me back years just to still be a slave anyways? I'd rather be dead than do that. I work at a pizza place making 8.75/hr and live with my parents. My brother and I want to move out but I can't imagine doing that because that'll require me to find another job to enslave myself in and thats just not how I want my life to go on. I've seen plenty of threads here on Reddit talking about how they can't keep doing this life of working all day coming home exhausted then sleeping and doing it all over again. Like I said I'm 19 and I feel exhausted just working 6 hours a day, I'm still a teenager I should be running around young wild and free enjoying life. I sleep about 12-14 hours a day and I still take naps and otherwise I'm alone in my room playing videos games just to keep my mind off this hellbent reality I was given or typing shit on Reddit because I feel so helpless that I need someone else on the internet to see if they can give me any advise. I have absolutely no social life, never had a girlfriend, still a virgin and unbearably lonely plus the realization that I either must be a slave for the rest of my life or a worthless homeless nobody on the street has caused me to become deathly depressed. I barely even eat because I'm too depressed to even crave food, I can tell I'm hungry but mentally I have no interest in food unless I'm smoking weed. I've tried meditation and have a strong interest in psychedelics for personal development but all thats done is make me realize just how fake and unreal this 21 century society really is. I'd rather live in the wild foraging for food like a monkey over working my ass off for hours a day just for (money) green paper that people think is so good and meaningful I just don't understand. It feels like I was born on the wrong planet or the wrong time and to make it all worse no matter how long I sit and logically think about it I cannot think of  way out of this hell other than suicide, just selling my time/life away as a slave, or just being homeless. And to top it all off when I was 13 or 14 my hair started thinning and during high school with my thin hair everyone (Including every single person close to me even teachers) started making fun of me saying things like \"crackhead\" or \"you look like an old man\", \"you look like a hobo\", \"Looks like Albert Einstein\", \"Do you wash your hair?\" and while it sounds hilarious from an outside perspective eventually after hearing dozens of different people say this constantly my entire junior/senior year it has really dragged me through hell and back just trying to keep myself from going completely insane and it caused me to completely lose any self confidence I once had. All that I really want is a female to love me and a place of my own to stay at without having to owe other people anything. Just me and a lover free to be ourselves to do what we want, live how we want but there's always someone else who thinks its in their place for you to owe them money and money is whats completely ruined my idea of a happy life. Its literally unfair for someone else to tell me  how to live but the government thinks they can tell people weed is \"illegal\" to possess yet thats fake as fuck like nothing is illegal if it was then some nonhuman force would seek redemption for me possessing weed but no, its other people telling ME that I'll be punished by other human beings if I have weed by throwing me in a cage for doing something of my own consent.  (or insert anything illegal that I choose to have in my life) Does the government have consent of MY BODY? Yes they do if they can throw me in a cage for ingesting something of my choosing. Is living as a truly independent human just completely impossible? To live without being under someone else's rule?  Or is that gift only given to animals in nature who don't have to live by human code? I'd literally rather be dead or anything else other than human. I just don't know what to do anymore I just live each day so sad and depressed, nothing excites me anymore and I have absolutely no motivation to even try anything anymore. I 100% don't blame drug addicts for their choices in life, smoking weed does help me feel better about myself and the position I'm in but at the end of the day all it does is make me feel better about life in that exact moment and does nothing for me in the long run which from my point of view seems completely doomed of being meaningful anyways. I'd love to have two children but if they had to go through what I'm going through right now then all their pain and depression would be all my fault and this life just isn't something I'd want to give to someone else its just not worth it. I'm too much of a wimp to just shoot myself but at the same time it'd just be so easy, I just hope that some accident happens to me thats quick and painless. There's a gun safe in my brothers room and just about every day I just imagine how peaceful it'd be after I kill myself to no longer be bound to this unforgiving world. Its almost too good to be true but I guess thats a fair trade for my life.\n",

      "Before I was born, my parents (who had met at 12 and 13, and are still married at 41 and 42) were severely abusive to each other. Physical fights, using weapons or objects to harm each other, severe emotional abuse. My mom tells me about a time she kicked my dad down the stairs 3 times while he was drunk, just for fun, and laughed at him each time. She laughed about it as she told the story despite the mortified look on my face. I swear, there's something wrong with her. Both of my parents had really bad home lives growing up, apparently, but my dad especially.\n",

      "Anyway, my dad was an alcoholic troublemaker who always ended up in juvy, or eventually jail. My mom was some sort of sick twisted bitch or whatever. She ended up in jail pretty often, too.

      "\n",
      "My mom has emotionally abused for my entire life using this fact. She has essentially turned me into a perfectionist and led me to believe that it was my fault, and not hers. She has never accepted anything less than straight A's and perfection, but instead of punishing me like a normal kid (grounding or no allowance or more chores), she would scream at me until she was blue in the face and occasionally beat or shove or throw me, yelling about how I was a disappointment and a failure to her. She emotionally neglected me as well; she never paid attention to me or gave me praise unless I was doing something that  she wanted me to do. She knows nothing about me, and \"loves\" the image of me she has made. She says I am a waste of money, and makes me feel guilty for needing basic things like food and health care. (We are pretty poor, but I think that is overstepping the line.) She vicariously lives her life through me because she ruined her life at my age; she stayed with my dad and dropped out of college to have me at 22.\n",

I have no self esteem, no self respect, and if I'm honest? I have no personality or sense of self, either. I live with an overlying sense of guilt that I am at fault and that I deserve to be hurt, or worse. I have no hobbies and no interests, and never have. I do not enjoy anything I do in the slightest. To cope with not feeling anything, I have (kinda) reckless sex, hurt myself, and binge drink. I also occasionally smoke weed. The way my mom has treated me has ended up with me being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). After a hospitalization at 15, I was diagnosed with adolescent borderline personality disorder, so I have had it for a while now. Several therapists said I showed all traits by the age of 13 but couldn't diagnose me because of my young age.\n",

      "\n",
      "Anyways, moving on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So firstly, I'm living with completely untreated BPD. The nearest specialist is an hour and a half away, and I have really bad insurance. My disability checks were taken away when I turned 18 last year, and my mom gets mad at me when I try to call to ask to fix this. My life is a living hell. I feel nothing at all, but at the same time, I feel everything at once. There is a void that I can't fill no matter how hard I try and I'm in agony. Suicide is always on my mind, every hour of every day. I hurt myself often and binge drink to deal with the stress, or occasionally have reckless unsafe sex or smoke pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was first brought to therapy, my therapist and psychiatrist had evaluated me for autism spectrum disorder and ADHD, and tried to refer me to a specialist. My mom screamed in his face that her perfect child could never be autistic. I have never been evaluated again, but have talked to my school counselor. She says I'm most likely living with untreated ADHD or autism spectrum disorder, but most MOST likely both at once. (My brother, who is emotionally and intellectually disabled, has both of these. So does my dad. It's in my genetics.) I have a hard time focusing on or doing anything, whether it be school or things outside of school. This includes hobbies or being with friends. My grades are piss poor right now, which adds to my guilt and depression. I want to do my work and make my teachers proud, but I haven't been able to focus on/understand the lessons and I lose all of my stuff a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the age of 11 or 12, I developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. I was constantly in a state of such anxiety that almost anything could set off a panic attack. I would hyperventilate and cry until I threw up, and would occasionally shit my pants in fear. I was also severely depressed; I had no energy or motivation to do anything. I would hurt myself every day. Around this time I also realized that I had gender dysphoria and was bisexual. I told my mom about all of this, because as a 12 year old you're  supposed to go to your mom about your problems. She shamed me, she blamed me, she screamed at me. I had to threaten to hurt and kill myself to get her to do anything to help me. My panic attacks have since tapered off, and I don't have them as often now.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, my mom thinks I am not trans and that I am straight. I suppressed both my gender and sexuality for years, but my gender dysphoria has come back tenfold. I'm too scared to tell her but.. I can't live as a woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "My grades have been pretty not great since 9th grade. I'm really smart still, I just have a really hard time paying attention in class and am too depressed to do my assignments. With enough effort (not much) I can pull A's in most of my classes, and at the  very worst a low B, but nowadays, I don't have the energy to put out that effort anymore. I'm looking at a solid D in every class I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "I unfortunately have attempted suicide twice. My mom got really angry at me both times and didn't console me in any way. Just blamed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I live with constant guilt. Whenever I make a mistake, I hurt myself. Consciously or not. I have scars up and down my arms and all over my fingers from stress-picking, and my shoulders and thighs and stomach are covered in self-harm scars. It does not matter if it's a big mistake or a small mistake. I cannot deal with the guilt of fucking up even a little bit, so I hurt myself to punish myself. It's the only thing that makes me feel a little better when I fuck up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been sexually abused 3 times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first instance started at the age of 10 and ended at the age of around 12. My childhood best friend had started acting really strangely, cutting me off for no reason and telling me he hated me and treating me like shit. Essentially, we made a trade; I get to stay friends with him if I send him videos and pictures of myself. He never told me why he started acting this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second time was the worst one. There is serious background to this. I made a new best friend in 4th grade, and we have been super close ever since. We had a mutual crush on each other for years. In 9th grade, I couldn't handle the stress anymore, and set my suicide date as New Years 2017. By some stroke of luck, my best friend invited me to an Xbox party and talked to me all night long and distracted me from killing myself, and we confessed our feelings for each other that night and started dating on January 4th, 2017, during my 9th grade year. We have been together ever since. However, in 10th grade, he admitted to me that he had a fat fetish. I was mortified; I was pretty overweight back then from stress eating, and had no self esteem, but I tried it out because I loved him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was horrible. I told him we needed to stop doing that, and that I was going to get fit and lose weight. He then insisted that if I did that, he wouldn't love me anymore. I was terrified of being abandoned by the love of my life, and sex was the only form of intimacy I knew at this point, so I didn't want to lose the only things I cared about. I kept doing it for him. It would make me cry and have panic attacks and occasionally throw up, but he didn't stop. I kept telling him that it was okay because I didn't want him to leave me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I developed severe anorexia because of this. I haven't told anyone about it because I don't want professionals to get rid of it. It's a comfort for me; I need to be as skinny as possible. I cannot be fat or I will kill myself. (I also don't have time to be hospitalized for something like this right now. I am in the midst of scholarship applications and making money for college.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that I am skinny, I am severely paranoid that he loves me less and doesn't like the way that I look. He has admitted both of those things. When he's in a bad mood, he'll insult me about how I'm not sexually good enough for him anymore and that my body is ugly because I'm so skinny. I don't feel good enough, because I clearly am not. He reassures me that he still loves me personality and my face but frankly that's really shitty, if you ask me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fat fetish thing doesn't happen anymore, but I'm not good enough for him now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm too scared to leave though. He has been my best friend for like, a decade. I don't want to lose what we've had. This is the biggest problem I face right now aside from the abuse I endure from my mom. This is the reason I had attempted suicide, both times. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was drugged and violently raped at a party by one of my friends at 16 while everyone was sleeping. I don't really want to talk about that one. It was just rape, I guess. Uncomfortable situation. It was the least emotionally taxing of the three, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have C-PTSD. I have nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, episodes of dissociation. I throw up or have an episode when people touch me in the wrong places, especially my stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I have a beloved ferret named Slinky, and he wouldn't understand where I went if I died. He needs me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't want to die. No treatment I have gone through has ever worked for me. I have been on 3 different SSRIs so far (Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro) and none of them have put a dent in my mood. I have also been on Lamictal, a mood stabilizer. It didn't do anything, and they kept upping the dosage. I had to taper off of it because it was too much for my body to handle, and I would throw it up. I have been kicked out of several facilities for not responding to treatment in any way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, I make a little bit of money. I sell art and I work at my grandfather's gas station down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR\n",
      "Mom abused and neglected me to the point of not knowing how to function as a person, I have been sexually abused 3 times which resulted in an eating disorder, I am so mentally ill that I am in agony every day. I have untreated BPD, ADHD, C-PTSD and possibly autism. I have severe anxiety and depression that no treatment can put a dent in. I have been kicked out of several facilities for being completely unresponsive to treatment. I am transgender (FTM), pre-everything, in an unsafe environment, and drowning in dysphoria. I live with so much misdirected guilt from everything that the only things I think about are hurting or killing myself.\n",

We came back at the end of the break and as soon as we walked in this girl said \"speaking of the devil. We were just speaking about you\" and she was saying about my mate. I sat down on my seat and I got a message from my mate telling me that they were chatting shit about me, these two girls. They were going on about how I was ugly and how I can't get any girls and stuff. It didn't bother me about what they said, but should I have said something back, I'm not really looking for drama especially right now where I have a situation going on with a girl. I just want some advice on what I should've done or next time if I catch them talking about me. By the way, I didn't say anything to them girls, they said this randomly. Also, I am not a player or anything either so I don't know why she would have said that.\n",

      "Annotations: So I have been depressed all of my life as long as I can remember. I didn't really know what its like to not have that sinking, dreadful feeling in my heart. That is -until I met my current boyfriend. He makes me feel alive and happy again. He pulled me out of the darkness I was so deep in. But I can feel myself starting to slip again, and I'm trying so hard to not let it drag me down. I used to self harm, and I promised him I'd try as hard as I could to not do it again. For like 3 weeks before the present one, I was completely absolutely numb. I didn't laugh, didn't cry, didn't feel anything at all. It was the worst feeling in my life, It felt like I just died and had no soul or heartbeat, but worse. It was terrifying, and I never want to go through it again. But after about three weeks of feeling that way, I self-harmed, partially to prove I could still feel something. And for some reason, I didn't feel the sadness I usually do when I relapse. I just felt *alive*. And I slipped out of that terrible numb feeling. I feel alive now, and still numb, but not as bad as before. But the problem is, I've slipped into a different type of numbness. It's like I don't care about anything anymore. I have 3 grades below a 50, and I really don't have the energy or motivation to care, even though I want to. I honestly wouldn't care If i just got hit by a truck or like had a heart attack, but its not like i'm gonna go out of my way to make it happen. I want to stop this before it slips too deep but I don't know how.\n",

      "Annotations: Im (28m) shes (49f)There's a lot of backstory here so ill try to sum up some main points for context. My mother has substance abuse issues all through my life. It caused me to live with my grandparents multiple timea in my life from 3-6 then again from 11-16 til my grandmother died and i had nowhere else to go. I ended up living with her due to some medical issues for myself at the time i had to drop out of school.and get my GED and a job. She made me pay rent 250 a month full time 40 hours a week back then i was making roughly 280 dollars a week. Whatever pay rent no problem even though Id be more supportive of my kid going through a terrible time but whatever. I also had to pay for my own food and such.The problem was a lot. My room was storage for her and her boyfriend i literally had just a bed and the rest were boxes of junk the boyfriend who was a hoarder didnt want to throw out. On top of that he was a terrible person who would constantly bad mouth my mother, steal my weed and other things from my room(i actually caught him on camera and showed him and he still denied it to my face.) One day he did it in front of me and i beat the shit outta him and i ended up leaving and sleeping on friends couches etc. Now at the time I would've fucking killed for my mother. So her picking him over me kinda broke my heart back then but it is what it is. Fast forward a couple years(20) i ended up living back with her doing the same stuff but this time at least i had a room that didnt have junk in it. But the abusive boyfriend was still there and it was the same pay rent and.  all of my food. She starts letting her friends from the methadone clinic she goes too stay in the house...for FREE🤦‍♂️. Another thing she been on methadone for like 13 years, that's not how methadone should work but fuck it im no doctor. 4 years later she makes a big deal about money and all this stuff and i go to find out that, first she never used my money to pay rent, it turned out from me talking to our landlord that she owed almost 6 months of backrent! I also found out that the boyfriend didn't contribute to any of the finances so at a young age she put her financial responsibility in my hands. We ended up getting evicted and I was pissed and didnt talk to her for 2 years then she got cancer. So i did what i felt was the right thing and was there for her regardless. She got better and now well this whole thing came from a argument the other day we had. I have major depression and i was trying to ask for help and she got mad at me cause i told her i can't talk to her about it. She asked why and i told her the truth that i dont wanna have a who had a sadder life competition. Because she has a habit of if i was to complain about my childhood instead of listening or sympathizing she would bring up things like oh i was molested my childhood wasn't that great. Yeah that's fucking terrible and all that but that doesn't excuse your decision for you children. You're supposed to work to make things better for them. Which is the only valuable life lesson she taught me, because she never did it. Now im in a ok place I'm in school full time work 2 jobs all so i can have a easier life, and she don't understand that I'm busy even though i told her this. Honestly she's the reason for a lot of my depression. it sucks having to coddle a parent, i have no guidance i feel lost half the time and she will never understand that.\n",

First of all, she told me the counselor didn't mention it, but made her understand it in a subtle way. Also, she doesn't exhibit any signs of depression, she doesn't have a lack of interest in doing things, or a change in appetite. I feel very bad writing this, I know every depression is different, but she has no problems going through the day, and it's always the one to ask to hang out for example, while I couldn't (and sometimes still can't) get out of bed in the morning, let alone function properly. \n",

This means people say things to me without thinking how I might feel about it. I also do not share my past memories with others- I need to move on. I cannot blame them for their ignorance, that would be rude.  So when people get mad, and yell at me, I leave my face blank and take it. But it's been hard lately. When my mom gets upset with me, practically anything that leaves my mouth is talking back or an excuse. It makes me feel like her scolding me about being ungrateful means I don't deserve what she gives me- that I don't deserve a loving mother, I deserve what I had, and that my feelings are excuses. But I take it, and I bounce back.Those outside of family know me as a happy, innocent, smart, and responsible person. If I am ever anything except some state of happy, people think it's weird of me. Because I always get back on my feet without them knowing I fell. But I am so tired of getting back up. Of forgiving everyone that has hurt me over and over. Of taking all of those offensive comments silently. Of fulfilling the expectations of those around me when I already expect perfection out of myself. Of trying to put effort into my appearance only to look at my own hands and feel revolted. Of acting. Of not feeling good enough for anyone.**I sometimes wish I had a normal life, but look back on it and would rather it be me than anyone else. And I want someone to see that. To not think I am vein or naive, instead looking into me. Looking at my pain, my struggles, my scars, my fighting, and be grateful. To hold me and say it was worth it, that I am strong. To let my tears fall, and look me in the eyes and say \"thank you\".**\n",

      "Annotations: I’m 16F btw. For many many years I’ve been extremely upset with my weight and my looks. I hate everything about me, I could give you all the things I hate about my appearance in a heartbeat. Sometimes when I look in the mirror I think “oh I don’t look too bad” and sometimes I think “oh god I can’t go out I’m so ugly”. My weight has become a really bad obsession. I think that because of problems relating to how I see myself I might have gotten and eating disorder? I’m not sure because I can’t self diagnose. But, I have lost noticeable amount of weight by eating 1-2 times a day and limiting my calories. And I’m not sure if that’s extreme dieting or an actual eating disorder. I’m scared to go to the extreme and go underweight (I’m close to being it) because I have a deadly disease and could die if I’m not eating properly. And I’m not too educated on ED’s so I’m not sure if I’m being too dramatic. Back to my “depression”, I moved during 5th grade and had no friends until high school, people openly avoided me because I kept asking people if I could play with them. This one group of friends made it extremely obvious that they don’t want to be near me, which hurt a lot. Lots of boys said behind my back and in my face that I’m ugly, horrifying, repulsive, a ugly octopus, sewer rat, etc. That really hurt me back then, still now. And I do believe I’m all those things they’ve said. Then a miracle happened. I made a friend. She was a cool kid and the time I spent with her was the best I’ve ever had with someone besides my family. Then after few months out of no where she acts like I don’t exist. She never spoke to me and treated me like a stranger, and it hurt so much it still bothers me. I thought that I did something wrong, that I wasn’t good enough, or I was too ugly that she didn’t want to be seen with me. Then in high school I finally made friends. During 10th grade my friend told me that my crush of 6 years called me super ugly and said who would want to date her? That shattered everything. And now I believe that I’m so repulsive that I will never find love and I will be lonely forever. Fortunately, I made friends, and one cool thing I do with a group I’m really close with is that we have “therapy” sessions and we talk about our problems and try to cheer each other up. I’ve yet to have my “session” yet, but I accidentally gave away that I hate my body and they think I have body dysmorphia, I think I have it too but I can’t say cause I haven’t been diagnosed. Honestly it made me feel so good that there were people who were concerned about me but that never happened again. They never speak about it like they speak about other friends problems... That’s probably because I haven’t told them all this, and I would’ve but I’m afraid. What if all of this is me being too dramatic. And that what I’m feeling isn’t serious and they think bad of me. And I’m scared to go to a therapist because of that same reason. So I rather keep all these emotions inside, and almost every night I cry because of these problems. Most of the times at night, I feel empty, lifeless. If I close my eyes I imagine I’m floating through space lifeless. My thoughts are very dangerous because I keep thinking more negative, and to avoid that I go on my phone and distract myself by doing something. Because of my disease I have to take pills daily, and I’ve always thought that I have an easy chance to kill myself by taking a lot of them, but I don’t think I would because it’s a sin in my religion, but maybe one day I’m too down that I might do something... Can someone please tell me if this is depression or not, because I really want to overcome it. Please reply to this, I’ve made many posts on other subreddits regarding this and no one has answered, which makes me feel like no one truly cares. Thank you.\n",

I immediately went and bought some men’s deodorant since it tends to be stronger, but I was hoping someone might have a better way for me to combat this.

      "\n",
      "I (30/f) met my partner (32/m) at university eight years ago. He was a very fun, open and active guy with a huge social group. After two years of being friends we started dating. It was around that time that he was done with all his courses and papers and the only thing left for him to finish uni was to write his bachelor's thesis. That didn't happen for another four years.   \n",
      "Within that time he basically didn't do anything. Didn't write his thesis, didn't get a job. He told me, that he had no clue, what he wants to do with his life and I tried to encourage him to just do some internships to figure that out, but he never did. He is fortunate enough that his parents pay for his expenses (always did and still do), so money wouldn't be the problem. He never did any internship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward six years and the situation is still the same. He did eventually finish his bachelor's and started a master's degree but realized that studying just isn't for him. However he still isn't properly searching for jobs or internships or general input that would help him figure out, what he wants to do or be. The thing is, that his self esteem is lower than the mariana trench. He feels like he doens't know anything and is underqualified for basically every job. He's not. He's incredibly smart, attentive and detail orientated and has a great passion for social justice but he keeps telling himself that he isn't enough for any job and he doens't dare to apply. I don't know how to help him. All my affirmations seem to not penetrate his mindfog. However, the problem is that I'm the only one he's talking to. Because he realized that all his peers moved on he stopped having contact with them because he was embarassed. \n",

He doesn't go to therapy and I don't know, if he really tried to get a therapist but the waiting lists are too long or if he didn't try hard enough. He won't tell me. Same thing with his job situation. I don't know, if he is searching and for what. Everytime I ask him, what he wants to be or do he tells me, he doesn't know. And I started asking him really deconstructed questions like \"what kind of activities (writing texts/organizing events/making statistic sheets/etc) do you like?\" \"do you want to work alone or in a team?\" \"what goals (helping people and what kind of people/income/etc) do you want to be met?\" and so on.

Everytime I suggest something, he doesn't use that info, but feels stupid, becaus he didn't have the idea himself. Doesn't matter that I keep reassuring him that it is okay, to need help or not know everything on the spot. He feels stupid and blocks any further conversation and than i find myself trying to calm him down and in the end he promises me to change things, but never does. Probably because he really doesn't have the energy, I get that on an intellectual level. I understand it. I still feel extremely frustrated.\n",

I want to get married and have children and start the next chapter. I can't do that with a man who barely survives. And it starts to severely affect me. I get so impatient with him and sometimes I find myself blaming him and I know, that is a terrible thing to do to a depressed person and that i should be patient and understanding. But I'm carrying this alone, because he doesn't talk to anyone else about his struggles. \n",

I didn't realize it at first, because we're always together. But I feel like I can't be happy, because he isn't. I feel like I can't rejoice over my little victories because he has none. I want to talk about my masters and my ideas for work and all the new input I'm getting (I am studying for a master's degree btw), but I feel guilty, because he isn't passionate about anything. I feel like i can't live my life because I know, that everything I do reminds him of all the things, he doesn't (earning money, socialize, building a future, personal growth).\n",

I live alone and it’s very common for me to not reply to my friends and family, I don’t think people would notice for days. I tried anti depressants for the first time, which was a big step for me. SSRI. I became more suicidal but they also knocked me out for about a week. I came off them and felt great for two days bc I had energy. Then felt the dark cloud coming back and tried to work with my psych to help myself not get drenched again, maybe just a light shower and get back up. But now I’ve suffered a big emotional blow in one of my relationships - and I’m just not equipped to handle such a thing right now. I can only talk to my psych and my friend about it. My friend hasn’t responded and I haven’t got a psych appointment for 3 weeks. Usually knowing I’ll see her weekly helps me get through the hard days\n",
